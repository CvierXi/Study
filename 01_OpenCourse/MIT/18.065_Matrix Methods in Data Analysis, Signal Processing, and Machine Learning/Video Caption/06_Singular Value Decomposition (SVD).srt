8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,960
PROFESSOR: So this is a big
day mathematically speaking,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,320
because we come to
this key idea, which is

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
a little bit like eigenvalues.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,970
Well, a lot like
eigenvalues, but different

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:44,410
because the matrix A now is
more usually rectangular.

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,250
So for a rectangular matrix,
the whole idea of eigenvalues

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,160
is shot because if I
multiply A times a vector

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,590
x in n dimensions, out will
come something in m dimensions

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,810
and it's not going
to equal lambda x.

17
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:08,620
So Ax equal lambda x is not even
possible if A is rectangular.

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,330
And even if A is square, what
are the problems, just thinking

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,420
for a minute about eigenvalues?

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,950
The case I wrote up
here is the great case

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,790
where I have a symmetric
matrix and then it's

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,720
got a full set of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
and they're
orthogonal, all good.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,730
But for a general square
matrix, either the eigenvectors

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,800
are complex--

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,550
eigenvalues are complex
or the eigenvectors

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,870
are not orthogonal.

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,410
So we can't stay with
eigenvalues forever.

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,000
That's what I'm saying.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
And this is the
right thing to do.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,910
So what are these pieces?

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:07,710
So these are the left and these
are the right singular vectors.

33
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,035
So this is the new
word is singular.

34
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,660
And in between go the--

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,790
not the eigenvalues,
but the singular values.

36
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,780
So we've got the
whole point now.

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,690
You've got to pick up on this.

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,490
There are two sets of
singular vectors, not one.

39
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,540
For eigenvectors, we just
had one set, the Q's.

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,690
Now we have a
rectangular matrix,

41
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,870
we've got one set of left
eigenvectors in m dimensions,

42
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,630
and we've got another
set of right eigenvectors

43
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,030
in n dimensions.

44
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,280
And numbers in between
are not eigenvalues,

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,700
but singular values.

46
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,770
So these guys are--

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,150
let me write what
that looks like.

48
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,090
This is, again, a diagonal
matrix sigma 2 to sigma r,

49
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,470
let's say.

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,250
So it's again, a diagonal
matrix in the middle.

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:26,670
But the numbers on the
diagonal are all positive or 0.

52
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,110
And they're called
singular values.

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,920
So it's just a different world.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,940
So really, the first step by
have to do, the math step,

55
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,550
is to show that
any matrix can be

56
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,630
factored into u times
sigma times v transpose.

57
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,810
So that's the parallel
to the spectral theorem

58
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,650
that any symmetric matrix
could be factored that way.

59
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,380
So you're good for that part.

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,230
We just have to do it to see
what are u and sigma and v?

61
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,280
What are those vectors
and those singular values?

62
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,810
Let's go.

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:16,990
So the key is that A
transpose A is a great matrix.

64
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:24,370
So that's the key to the
math is A transpose A. So

65
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,650
what are the properties
of A transpose A?

66
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,970
A is rectangular again.

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,710
So maybe m by n A transpose.

68
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,715
So this was m by n.

69
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:39,760
And this was n by m.

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,500
So we get a result
that's n by n.

71
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,630
And what else can you tell
me about A transpose A?

72
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,780
It's a metric.

73
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,610
That's a big deal.

74
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,230
And it's square.

75
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,690
And well yeah, you
can tell me more now,

76
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,690
because we talked
about something,

77
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,390
a topic that's a little more
than symmetric last time.

78
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,070
The matrix A transpose A
will be positive, definite.

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,990
It's eigenvalues are
greater or equal to 0.

80
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,190
And that will mean that we
can take their square roots.

81
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,720
And that's what we will do.

82
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,020
So A transpose A we'll
have a factorization.

83
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,380
It's symmetric.

84
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,200
It'll have a like, a Q
lambda Q transpose, but I'm

85
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,630
going to call it V lambda--

86
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,610
no, yeah, lambda-- I'll still
call it lambda V transpose.

87
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,700
So these V's-- what do we know
about eigenvectors of these

88
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,180
V's or eigenvectors of this guy?

89
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,030
Square, symmetric,
positive, definite matrix.

90
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,740
So we're in good shape.

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,420
And what do we know about the
eigenvalues of A transpose A?

92
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,380
They are all positive.

93
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,230
So the eigenvalues are--
well, or equal to 0.

94
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,905
And these guys are orthogonal.

95
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,780
And these guys are
greater or equal to there.

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,700
So that's good.

97
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,520
That's one of our--

98
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,300
We'll depend a lot on that.

99
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,365
But also, you've got
to recognize that A,

100
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:24,310
A transpose is a different
guy, A, A transpose.

101
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,300
So what's the shape
of A, A transpose?

102
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,160
How big is that?

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,180
Now I've got-- what do I have?

104
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,220
M by n times n by m.

105
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,580
So this will be what size?

106
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,340
N by m.

107
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,370
Different shape but with
the same eigenvalues--

108
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,510
the same eigenvalues.

109
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,210
So it's going to have some other
eigenvectors, u-- of course,

110
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,752
I'm going to call
them u, because I'm

111
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,330
going to go in over there.

112
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,140
They'll be the same.

113
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, they're saying
yeah, let me--

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,650
I shouldn't-- I have to
say when I say the same,

115
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,690
I can't quite literally
mean the very same,

116
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,700
because this has got n
eigenvalues and this has m

117
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,650
eigenvalues.

118
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,660
But the missing guys, the
ones that are in one of them

119
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,110
and not in the other, depending
on the sizes, are zeros.

120
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,670
So really, the heart of the
thing, the non-zero eigenvalues

121
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,290
are the same.

122
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,210
Well actually, I've
pretty much revealed

123
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,350
what the SVD is going to use.

124
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,520
It's going to use the U's from
here and the V's from here.

125
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
But that's the story.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,550
You've got to see that story.

127
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,330
So fresh start on the
singular value decomposition.

128
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,110
What are we looking for?

129
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,990
Well, as a factorization--

130
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,030
so we're looking for--

131
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:12,450
we want A. We want vectors v,
so that when I multiply by v--

132
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,100
so if it was an eigenvector,
it would be Av equal lambda v.

133
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,600
But now for A, it's rectangular.

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,530
It hasn't got eigenvectors.

135
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:31,780
So Av is sigma, that the
new singular value times u.

136
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,169
That's the first guy and the
second guy and the rth guy.

137
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,740
I'll stop at r, the rank.

138
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,350
Oh, yeah.

139
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:46,880
Is that what I want?

140
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,740
A-- let me just see.

141
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,200
Av is sigma u.

142
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,570
Yeah, that's good.

143
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,750
So this is what takes the
place of Ax equal lambda x.

144
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,200
A times one set of
singular vectors

145
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,590
gives me a number of times the
other set of singular vectors.

146
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,010
And why did I stop
at r the rank?

147
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,360
Because after that,
the sigmas are 0.

148
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,700
So after that, I could
have some more guys,

149
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:29,030
but they'll be in the null
space 0 on down to of Vn.

150
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,460
So these are the important ones.

151
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,910
So that's what I'm looking for.

152
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,680
Let me say it now in words.

153
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,540
I'm looking for a bunch
of orthogonal vectors v

154
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,330
so that when I
multiply them by A

155
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,910
I get a bunch of
orthogonal vectors u.

156
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,570
That is not so clearly possible.

157
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,090
But it is possible.

158
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,320
It does happen.

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,840
I'm looking for one set
of orthogonal vectors

160
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,960
v in the input
space, you could say,

161
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,850
so that the Av's in the output
space are also orthogonal.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,390
In our picture of
the fundamental--

163
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,560
the big picture
of linear algebra,

164
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,530
we have v's in this space, and
then stuff in the null space.

165
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:34,190
And we have u's over
here in the columns space

166
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,160
and some stuff in the
null space over there.

167
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,840
And the idea is that I
have orthogonal v's here.

168
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,820
And when I multiply by A--

169
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,920
so multiply by A--

170
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,760
then I get orthogonal u's over
here, orthogonal to orthogonal.

171
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,260
That's what makes the
V's and they u's special.

172
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,510
Right?

173
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,370
That's the property.

174
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,960
And then when we
write down-- well,

175
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,390
let me write down
what that would mean.

176
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,950
So I've just drawn a
picture to go with this--

177
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,930
those equations.

178
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,610
That picture just goes
with these equations.

179
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,970
And let me just write
down what it means.

180
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,200
It means in matrix--
so I've written it.

181
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,653
Oh yeah, I've written it here
in vectors one at a time.

182
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,070
But of course,
you, know I'm going

183
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,610
to put those vectors into
the columns of a matrix.

184
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:44,380
So A times v1 up to
let's say vr will equal--

185
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,490
oh yeah.

186
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,780
It equals sigma as times u.

187
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,420
So this is what I'm
after is u1 up to ur

188
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,400
multiplied by sigma
1 along to sigma r.

189
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,540
What I'm doing now
is just to say I'm

190
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,360
converting these
individual singular

191
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,680
vectors, each v going
into a u to putting them

192
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,300
all together into a matrix.

193
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,670
And of course, what I've written
here is Av equals u sigma,

194
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,300
Av equals u sigma.

195
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,550
That's what that amounts to.

196
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,790
Well, then I'm going to put
a v transpose on this side.

197
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,520
And I'm going to get to A
equals u sigma v transpose,

198
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,380
multiplying both sides
there by v transpose.

199
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,750
I'm kind of writing the same
thing in different forms,

200
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,155
matrix form, vector
at a time form.

201
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,440
And now we have to find them.

202
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,210
Now I've used up boards
saying what we're after,

203
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,430
but now we've got to get there.

204
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,335
So what are the v's
and what are the u's?

205
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,700
Well, the cool idea is to
think of A transpose A.

206
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,470
So you're with me
what we're for.

207
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,210
And now think about
A transpose A.

208
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,740
So if this is what
I'm hoping for,

209
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,700
what will A transpose
A turn out to be?

210
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,770
So big moment that's going
to reveal what the v's are.

211
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,000
So if I form A transpose A--

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,080
so A transpose-- so I got
to transpose this guy.

213
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,390
So A transpose is V sigma
transpose U transpose, right?

214
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:04,670
And then comes A, which is
this, U sigma V transpose.

215
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,040
So why did I do that?

216
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,810
Why is it that A transpose A
is the cool thing to look at

217
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,550
to make the problem simpler?

218
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,370
Well, what becomes simpler
in that line just written?

219
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,960
U transpose U is the
identity, because I'm looking

220
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,830
for orthogonal, in
fact orthonormal U's.

221
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,240
So that's the identity.

222
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,980
So this is V sigma
transpose sigma V transpose.

223
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,080
And I'll put parentheses
around that because that's

224
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,100
a diagonal matrix.

225
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,180
What does that tell me?

226
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,440
What does that tell all of us?

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,840
A transpose A has this form.

228
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,420
Now we've seen that form before.

229
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,320
We know that this is a
symmetric matrix, symmetric

230
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,090
and even positive definite.

231
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,160
So what are the v's?

232
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,860
The v's are the eigenvectors
of A transpose A.

233
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:20,770
This is the Q lambda Q transpose
for that symmetric matrix.

234
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,360
So we know the v's
are the eigenvectors,

235
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:32,040
v is the eigenvectors
of A transpose A.

236
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,820
I guess we're also going
to get the singular values.

237
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,760
So the sigma transpose sigma,
which will be the sigma squared

238
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:51,800
are the eigenvalues of
A transpose A. Good!

239
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,190
Sort of by looking for the
correct thing, U sigma V

240
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,790
transpose and then just
using the U transpose U

241
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,640
equal identity, we got
it back to something

242
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,800
we perfectly recognize.

243
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,430
A transpose A has that form.

244
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,400
So now we know what the V's are.

245
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,940
And if I do it the other way,
which, what's the other way?

246
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,220
Instead of A transpose
A, the other way

247
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,760
is to look at A, A transpose.

248
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,910
And if I write all
that down, that a

249
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,910
is the U sigma V transpose, and
the A transpose is the V sigma

250
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,230
transpose U transpose.

251
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,030
And again, this stuff
goes away and leaves me

252
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:45,610
with U sigma, sigma
transpose U transpose.

253
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,990
So I know what the U's are too.

254
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,990
They are eigenvectors
of A, A transpose.

255
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,670
Isn't that a beautiful symmetry?

256
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,940
You just-- A transpose
A and A, A transpose

257
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,440
are two different guys now.

258
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,089
So each has its own
eigenvectors and we use both.

259
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,680
It's just right.

260
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,190
And I just have to
take the final step,

261
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,730
and we've established the SVD.

262
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,550
So the final step is to remember
what I'm going for here.

263
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,030
A times a v is supposed
to be a sigma times a u.

264
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,960
See, what I have
to deal with now

265
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,870
is I haven't quite finished.

266
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,020
It's just perfect
as far as it goes,

267
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,710
but it hasn't gone to
the end yet because we

268
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,650
could have double eigenvalues
and triple eigenvalues,

269
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,590
and all those horrible
possibilities.

270
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,400
And if I have triple eigenvalues
or double eigenvalues,

271
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,030
then what's the deal
with eigenvectors

272
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,750
if I have double eigenvalues?

273
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,630
Suppose a matrix has
a symmetric matrix,

274
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,770
has a double eigenvalue.

275
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,610
Let me just take an example.

276
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:20,950
So symmetric matrix like
say, 1, 1, 5, make it.

277
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,550
Why not?

278
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,620
What's the deal
with eigenvectors

279
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,510
for that matrix 1, 1, 5?

280
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,610
So 5 has got an eigenvector.

281
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,720
You can see what it is, 0, 0, 1.

282
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,410
What about eigenvectors
that go with lambda equal 1

283
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,440
for that matrix?

284
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,230
What's up?

285
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,530
What would be eigenvectors
for a lambda equal 1?

286
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,040
Unfortunately, there was
a whole plane of them.

287
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,840
Any vector of the form x, y, 0.

288
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:04,220
Any vector in the x, y
plane would produce x, y, 0.

289
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,440
So I have a whole
plane of eigenvectors.

290
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,420
And I've got to pick two that
are orthogonal, which I can do.

291
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,940
And then they have to be--

292
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,860
in the SVD those
two orthogonal guys

293
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,420
have to go to two
orthogonal guys.

294
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,732
In other words, it's a
little bit of detail here,

295
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:28,710
a little getting into
this exactly what is--

296
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:38,950
well, actually, let
me tell you the steps.

297
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,710
So I use this to conclude that
the V's the singular vectors

298
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,270
should be eigenvalues.

299
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,240
I concluded those
guys from this step.

300
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Now I'm not going to
use this step so much.

301
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,010
Of course, it's in the back of
my mind but I'm not using it.

302
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,820
I'm going to get
the u's from here.

303
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:17,190
So u1 is A v1 over sigma
1 ur is Avr over sigma r.

304
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,330
You see what I'm doing here?

305
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm picking in a possible
plane of things the one I want,

306
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,490
the u's I want.

307
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,510
So I've chosen the v's.

308
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,640
I've chosen the sigmas.

309
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,750
They were fixed
for A transpose A.

310
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,780
The eigenvectors are
v's, the things--

311
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,770
the eigenvalues
are sigma squared.

312
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,460
And now then this
is the u I want.

313
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,980
Are you with me?

314
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,830
So I want to get
these u's correct.

315
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,150
And if I have a whole
plane of possibilities,

316
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,890
I got to pick the right one.

317
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,600
And now finally, I have to
show that it's the right one.

318
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,970
So what is left to show?

319
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:14,100
I should show that these u's are
eigenvectors of A, A transpose.

320
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,050
And I should show that
they're orthogonal.

321
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,850
That's the key.

322
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,320
I would like to show that
these are orthogonal.

323
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,420
And that's what goes
in this picture.

324
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,690
The v's-- I've got
orthogonal, guys,

325
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,410
because they're the eigenvectors
of a symmetric matrix.

326
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:37,850
Pick them orthogonal.

327
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,490
But now I'm multiplying
by A, so I'm

328
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:46,370
getting the u which is Av over
sigma for the basis vectors.

329
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,290
And I have to show
they're orthogonal.

330
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,490
So this is like
the final moment.

331
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,590
Does everything
come together right?

332
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,480
If I've picked the v's as the
eigenvectors of A transpose A,

333
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,420
and then I take these for
the u, are they orthogonal?

334
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,900
So I would like to think
that we can check that fact

335
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,550
and that it will come out.

336
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,570
Could you just help
me through this one?

337
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,716
I'll never ask for anything
again, just get the SVD one.

338
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,580
So I would like
to show that u1--

339
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,250
so let me put up what I'm doing.

340
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:47,610
I'm trying to show that
u1 transpose u2 is 0.

341
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,680
They're orthogonal.

342
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:57,890
So u1 is A v1 over sigma 1.

343
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,040
That's transpose.

344
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,740
That's u1.

345
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,000
And u2 is A v2 over sigma 2.

346
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,280
And I want to get 0.

347
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:13,560
The whole conversation
is ending right here.

348
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,866
Why is that thing 0?

349
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,370
The v's are orthogonal.

350
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,850
We know the v's are orthogonal.

351
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,070
They're orthogonal
eigenvectors of A transpose A.

352
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,580
Let me repeat that.

353
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:36,970
The v's are orthogonal
eigenvectors of A transpose A,

354
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,150
which I know we can find them.

355
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,520
Then I chose the u's to be this.

356
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,920
And I want to get the answer 0.

357
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,470
Are you ready to do it?

358
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,210
We want to compute
that and get 0.

359
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,580
So what do I get?

360
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,680
We just have to do it.

361
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,180
So I can see that the
denominator is that.

362
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:09,030
So is it v1 transpose
A transpose times A v2.

363
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,690
And I'm hoping to get 0.

364
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,060
Do I get 0 here?

365
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,240
You hope so.

366
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,060
v1 is orthogonal v2.

367
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,900
But I've got A transpose A
stuck in the middle there.

368
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,210
So what happens here?

369
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,230
How do I look at that?

370
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:44,960
v2 is an eigenvector of
A transpose A. Terrific!

371
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,670
So this is v1 transpose.

372
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,030
And this is the matrix times v2.

373
00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:00,420
So that's sigma 2
transpose v2, isn't it?

374
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,050
It's the eigenvector
with eigenvalue sigma

375
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,550
2 squared times v2.

376
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,825
Yeah, divided by
sigma 1 sigma 2.

377
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,000
So the A's are out of there now.

378
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,310
So I've just got these
numbers, sigma 2 squared.

379
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,900
So that would be
sigma 2 over sigma 1--

380
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,660
I've accounted for these numbers
here-- times v1 transpose v2.

381
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,810
And now what's up?

382
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,030
They're orthonormal.

383
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,200
We got it.

384
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,610
That's 0.

385
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,020
That is 0 there, yeah.

386
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,710
So not only are the v's
orthogonal to each other,

387
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:57,490
but because they're eigenvectors
of A transpose A, when

388
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,460
I do this, I discover
that the Av's

389
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:06,460
are orthogonal to each other
over in the column space.

390
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,010
So orthogonal v's in the
row space, orthogonal Av's

391
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,110
over in column space.

392
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,260
That was discovered late--
much long after eigenvectors.

393
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,980
And it's a interesting history.

394
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,430
And it just comes out right.

395
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:30,930
And then it was discovered,
but not much used, for oh,

396
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,670
100 years probably.

397
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:38,880
And then people saw that it
was exactly the right thing,

398
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,370
and data matrices
became important, which

399
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,060
are large rectangular matrices.

400
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,530
And we have not--

401
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,040
oh, I better say a word, just
a word here about actually

402
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,310
computing the v's and
sigmas and the u's

403
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:02,030
So how would you
actually find them?

404
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,870
What I most want to
say is you would not

405
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,065
go this A transpose A route.

406
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,750
Why is it like it?

407
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,300
Is that a big mistake?

408
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,180
If you have a matrix
A, say 5,000 by 10,000,

409
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,480
why is it a mistake
to actually use

410
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,790
A transpose A in
the computation?

411
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,840
We used it heavily in the proof.

412
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,530
And we could find another proof
that wouldn't use it so much.

413
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:45,310
But why would I not
multiply these two together?

414
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,320
It's very big, very expensive.

415
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,450
It adds in a whole
lot of round off--

416
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,780
you have a matrix that's now--

417
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,580
its vulnerability to round
off errors is squared--

418
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,220
that's called its condition
number-- gets squared.

419
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,560
And you just don't go there.

420
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,330
So the actual computational
methods are quite different.

421
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,770
And we'll talk about those.

422
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,550
But the A transpose
A, because it's

423
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:24,100
symmetric positive definite,
made the proof so nice.

424
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,640
You've seen the nicest
proof, I'd say, of the--

425
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,560
Now I should think
about the geometry.

426
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,150
So what does A
equal A for u sigma?

427
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:45,570
Maybe I take another
board, but it will fill it.

428
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,110
But it's a good U
sigma V transpose.

429
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,190
So it's got three factors there.

430
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,500
And I would like
then each factor

431
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,840
is kind of a special matrix.

432
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,980
U and V are orthogonal matrix.

433
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,090
So I think of
those as rotations.

434
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,370
Sigma is a diagonal matrix.

435
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,200
I think of it as stretching.

436
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,310
So now I'm just going
to draw the picture.

437
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,450
So here's unit vectors.

438
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,420
And the first thing--
so if I multiply by x,

439
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,370
this is the first
thing that happens.

440
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,530
So that rotates.

441
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,900
So here's x's.

442
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,720
Then V transpose x's.

443
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,730
That's still a circle
length and change

444
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,420
for those, when I multiply
by an orthogonal matrix.

445
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,670
But the vectors turned.

446
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,250
It's a rotation.

447
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,580
Could be a reflection, but
let's keep it as a rotation.

448
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,250
Now what does sigma do?

449
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,450
So I have this unit circle.

450
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,090
I'm in 2D.

451
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,390
So I'm drawing a
picture of the vectors.

452
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,120
These are the unit
vectors in 2D, x,y.

453
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,620
They got turned by
the orthogonal matrix.

454
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,160
What does sigma do
to that picture?

455
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,220
It stretches, because
sigma multiplies

456
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,500
by sigma 1 in the
first component,

457
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,120
sigma 2 in the second.

458
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,130
So it stretches these guys.

459
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,000
And let's suppose this is
number 1 and this is number 2,

460
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,190
this is number 1 and number 2.

461
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,320
So sigma 1, our
convention is sigma 1--

462
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
we always take sigma 1
greater or equal to sigma 2,

463
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,720
greater or equal whatever,
greater equal, sigma rank.

464
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,530
And they're all positive.

465
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,540
And the rest are 0.

466
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,890
So sigma 1 will be
bigger than sigma 2.

467
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,660
So I'm expecting a
circle goes to an ellipse

468
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,905
when you stretch--

469
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,480
I didn't get it quite
perfect, but not bad.

470
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:15,250
So this would be sigma
2 v2, sigma 1 v1,

471
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,890
and this would be sigma 2 v2.

472
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,105
And we now have an ellipse.

473
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,190
So we started with
x is in a circle.

474
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,540
We rotated.

475
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,560
We stretched.

476
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,610
And now the final step
is take these guys

477
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,650
and multiply them by u.

478
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,150
So this was the
sigma V transpose x.

479
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,050
And now I'm ready for the
u part which comes last

480
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,060
because it's at the left.

481
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,200
And what happens?

482
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,340
What's the picture now?

483
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,710
What does u do to the ellipse?

484
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,370
It rotates it.

485
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,820
It's another orthogonal matrix.

486
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,370
It rotates it
somewhere, maybe there.

487
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:11,330
And now we see the
u's, u2 and u1.

488
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,980
Well, let me think about that.

489
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,460
Basically, that's
not that's right.

490
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:34,010
So this SVD is telling us
something quite remarkable

491
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:36,800
that every linear
transformation,

492
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,040
every matrix
multiplication factors

493
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:46,020
into a rotation times a stretch
times a different rotation,

494
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,350
but possibly different.

495
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:55,240
Actually, when would the
u be the same as a v?

496
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,430
Here's a good question.

497
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,280
When is u the same as v
when are the two singular

498
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,030
vectors just the same?

499
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,190
AUDIENCE: A square.

500
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,220
PROFESSOR: Because A
would have to be square.

501
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,340
And we want this to be
the same as Q lambda Q

502
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,730
transpose if they're the same.

503
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,430
So the U's would be
the same as the V's

504
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,180
when the matrix is symmetric.

505
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,050
And actually we need it
to be positive definite.

506
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,830
Why is that?

507
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,290
Because our convention is these
guys are greater or equal to 0.

508
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,080
It's going to be
the same, then--

509
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,080
so far a positive
definite symmetric matrix,

510
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,740
the S that we started
with is the same

511
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,070
as the A on the next line.

512
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,340
Yeah, the Q is the U, the Q
transpose is the V transpose,

513
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,780
the lambda is the sigma.

514
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,520
So those are the good matrices.

515
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,580
And they're the ones that
you can't improve basically.

516
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,300
They're so good you can't make
a positive definite symmetric

517
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,070
matrix better than it is.

518
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:14,400
Well, maybe diagonalize
it or something, but OK.

519
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,239
Now I think of like,
one question here

520
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:26,830
that helps me anyway to
keep this figure straight,

521
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,820
how I want to count
the parameters

522
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,699
in this factorization.

523
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,980
So I am 2 by 2.

524
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,199
I'm 2 by 2.

525
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,110
So A has four
numbers, a, b, c, d.

526
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,510
Then I guess I feel
that four numbers should

527
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,440
appear on the right hand side.

528
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,190
Somehow the U and the
sigma and the V transpose

529
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,050
should use up a total
of four numbers.

530
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,780
So we have a counting
match between the left side

531
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,050
that's got four numbers a,
b, c, d, and the right side

532
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,360
that's got four numbers
buried in there somewhere.

533
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,690
So how can we dig them out?

534
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,340
How many numbers in sigma?

535
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,900
That's pretty clear.

536
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,462
Two, sigma 1 and sigma 2.

537
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,560
The two eigenvalues.

538
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,900
How many numbers
in this rotation?

539
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,340
So if I had a
different color chalk,

540
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,890
I would put 2 for the number of
things I counted for by sigma.

541
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:53,520
How many parameters does a
two by two rotation require?

542
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,020
One.

543
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,570
And what's a good
word for that one?

544
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:02,740
Is that one parameter?

545
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,380
It's like I have our
cos theta, sine theta,

546
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,000
minus sine theta, cos theta.

547
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,610
There's a number theta.

548
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,230
It's the angle it rotates.

549
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:18,380
So that's one guy to tell
the rotation angle, two guys

550
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:25,740
to tell the stretchings, and
one more to tell the rotation

551
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,070
from you, adding up to four.

552
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,620
So those count--
that was a match up

553
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,160
with the four numbers, a,
b, c, d that we start with.

554
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,450
Of course, it's a complicated
relation between those four

555
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,410
numbers and rotations
and stretches,

556
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,320
but it's four
equals four anyway.

557
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,720
And I guess if you
did three by threes--

558
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,390
oh, three by threes.

559
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,400
What would happen then?

560
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,780
So let me take three.

561
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,180
Do you want to care
for three by threes?

562
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,690
Just, it's sort of satisfying
to get four equal four.

563
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,590
But now what do we
get three by three?

564
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,050
We got how many numbers here?

565
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,550
Nine.

566
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,915
So where are those nine numbers?

567
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,420
How many here?

568
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,850
That's usually the easy--

569
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,470
three.

570
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,310
So what's your guess for
the how many in a rotation?

571
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,490
And a 3D rotation, you take
a sphere and you rotate it.

572
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,570
How many how many numbers
to tell you what's what--

573
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,410
to tell you what you did?

574
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:44,910
Three.

575
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,930
We hope three.

576
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,900
Yeah, it's going to be three,
three, and three for the three

577
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,520
dimensional world
that we live in.

578
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,300
So people who do rotations for a
living understand that rotation

579
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,378
in 3D, but how do you see this?

580
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:03,670
AUDIENCE: Roll, pitch, and yaw.

581
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,390
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

582
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,280
AUDIENCE: Roll, pitch and yaw.

583
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,750
PROFESSOR: Roll, pitch, and yaw.

584
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,740
That sounds good.

585
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,040
I mean, it's three words
and we've got it, right?

586
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,970
OK, yeah.

587
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,270
Roll, pitch and yaw.

588
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:19,030
Yeah, I guess a pilot hopefully,
knows about those three.

589
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

590
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,260
Which is roll?

591
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,030
When you are like
forward and back?

592
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,280
Does anybody, anybody?

593
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,840
Roll, pitch, and yaw?

594
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,415
AUDIENCE: Pitch is
the up and down one.

595
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,140
PROFESSOR: Pitch is
the up and down one.

596
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,640
OK.

597
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,550
AUDIENCE: Roll is like,
think of a barrel roll.

598
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,305
And yaw is your
side-to-side motion.

599
00:38:43,305 --> 00:38:46,980
PROFESSOR: Oh, yaw, you
stay in a plane and you--

600
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,270
OK, beautiful.

601
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,040
Right, right.

602
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,030
And that leads us to our
four-- four dimensions.

603
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,090
What's your guess on 4D?

604
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,130
Well, we could do
the count again.

605
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,670
If it was 4 by 4, we would
have 16 numbers there.

606
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,060
And in the middle, we always
have an easy time with that.

607
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,890
That would be 4.

608
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:10,620
So we've got 12
left to share out.

609
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,110
So six somehow-- six--

610
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:17,720
six angles in four dimensions.

611
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,220
Well, we'll leave it there.

612
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,210
OK.

614
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,330
So there is the SVD
but without an example.

615
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,990
Examples, you know, I would
have to compute A transpose A

616
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,220
and find it.

617
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,010
So the text will do that--

618
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,690
does it for a particular matrix.

619
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:39,930
Oh!

620
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,740
Yeah, the text does it
for a matrix 3, 4, 0,

621
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,260
5 that came out pretty well.

622
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,810
A few facts we
could learn though.

623
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,890
So if I multiply all
the eigenvalues together

624
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,160
for a matrix A, what do I get?

625
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,850
I get the determinant.

626
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:04,430
What if I multiply the
singular values together?

627
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,170
Well again, I get
the determinant.

628
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:10,190
You can see it right away
from the big formula.

629
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,000
Take determinant--
take determinant.

630
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,220
Well, assuming the
matrix A is square.

631
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,990
So it's got a determinant.

632
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,990
Then I take determinant
of this product.

633
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,660
I can take the
separate determinants.

634
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,890
That has determinant
equal to one.

635
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:39,120
An orthogonal matrix,
the determinant is one.

636
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,960
And similarly, here.

637
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,710
So the product of the sigmas
is also the determinant.

638
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,240
Yeah.

639
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,410
Yeah, so the product of the
sigmas is also the determinant.

640
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,130
The product of the
sigmas here will be 15.

641
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:59,960
But you'll find that sigma
one is smaller than lambda 1.

642
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,650
So here are the
eigenvalues, lambda 1

643
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,630
less or equal to lambda 2, say.

644
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,380
But the singular values
are outside them.

645
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,040
Yeah.

646
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,930
But they still multiply.

647
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,730
Sigma 1 times sigma
2 will still be 15.

648
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,770
And that's the same as
lambda 1 times lambda 2.

649
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:23,270
Yeah.

650
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,930
But overall, computing
the examples of the SVD

651
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,510
take more time because--

652
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,270
well, yeah, you just compute
A transpose A and you've got

653
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,930
the v's.

654
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,820
And you're on your way.

655
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,560
And you have to take the
square root of the eigenvalues.

656
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:54,390
So that's the SVD as
a piece of pure math.

657
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,170
But of course, what we'll do
next time starting right away

658
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,010
is use SVD.

659
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,540
And let me tell you
even today, the most--

660
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:11,910
yeah, yeah most important
pieces of the SVD.

661
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,300
So what do I mean by
pieces of the SVD?

662
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,860
I've got one more blackboard
still to write on.

663
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,200
So here we go.

664
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:30,380
So let me write out A is
the u's times the sigmas--

665
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,300
sigmas 1 to r times the v's--

666
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,540
v transpose v1 transpose
down to vr transpose.

667
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,240
So those are across.

668
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,790
Yeah.

669
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:48,940
Actually what I've
written here--

670
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,130
so you could say there
is a big economies.

671
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,400
There is a smaller size SVD
that has the real stuff that

672
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,720
really counts.

673
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,220
And then there's a larger SVD
that has a whole lot of zeros.

674
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,415
So this it would be the
smaller one, m by r.

675
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,410
This would be r by r.

676
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,570
And these would all be positive.

677
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,430
And this would be r by n.

678
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,720
So that's only using
the r non-zeros.

679
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,360
All these guys are
greater than zero.

680
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,590
Then the other one
we could fill out

681
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:43,882
to get a square
orthogonal matrix,

682
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:52,060
the sigmas and square v's v1
transpose to vn transpose.

683
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,000
So what are the shapes now?

684
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,030
This shape is m by m.

685
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,370
It's a proper orthogonal matrix.

686
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,680
This one also n by n.

687
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,740
So this guy has to be--
this is the sigma now.

688
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,280
So it has to be what size?

689
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,220
m by m.

690
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,800
That's the remaining space.

691
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,460
So it starts with the sigmas,
and then it's all zeros,

692
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,140
accounting for null space stuff.

693
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:23,630
Yeah.

694
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:29,130
So you should really see
that these two are possible.

695
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:34,100
That all these zeros
when you multiply out,

696
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,010
just give nothing, so
that really the only thing

697
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,250
that non-zero is in these bits.

698
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,080
But there is a complete one.

699
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:49,405
So what are these extra u's
that are in the null space of A,

700
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:51,970
A transpose or A transpose A?

701
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:57,290
Yeah, so two sizes, the large
size and the small size.

702
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:03,500
But then the things that
count are all in there.

703
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,820
OK.

704
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,940
So I was going to
do one more thing.

705
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,140
Let me see what it was.

706
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,130
So this is section
1.8 of the notes.

707
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,350
And you'll see examples there.

708
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:33,440
And you'll see a second
approach to the finding the u's

709
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,700
and v's and sigmas.

710
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,200
I can tell you what that is.

711
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:47,380
But maybe with just do
something nice at the end,

712
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:57,380
let me tell you about another
factorization of A that's

713
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:09,260
famous in engineering, and
it's famous in geometry.

714
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,740
So this is NEA is a
U sigma V transpose.

715
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,070
We've got that.

716
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,120
Now the other one
that I'm thinking of,

717
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,450
I'll tell you its name.

718
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,075
It's called the polar
decomposition of a matrix.

719
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,400
And all I want you to see
is that it's virtually here.

720
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,160
So a polar means--

721
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,310
what's polar in--
for a complex number,

722
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,990
what's the polar form
of a complex number?

723
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,280
AUDIENCE: e to the i theta.

724
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's e
to the i theta times r.

725
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,010
Yeah.

726
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,100
A real guy-- so
the real guy r will

727
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,490
translate into a symmetric guy.

728
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,190
And the e to the i theta
will translate into--

729
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,510
what kind of a matrix reminds
you of e to the i theta?

730
00:47:02,635 --> 00:47:03,510
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal.

731
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,650
PROFESSOR: Orthogonal, size 1.

732
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,022
So orthogonal.

733
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,460
So that's a very,
very kind of nice.

734
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,750
Every matrix factors
into a symmetric matrix

735
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,830
times an orthogonal matrix.

736
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:26,790
And I of course, describe these
as the most important classes

737
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,600
of matrices.

738
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:33,380
And here, we're saying every
matrix is a S times a Q.

739
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,220
And I'm also saying that
I can get that quickly out

740
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,410
of the SVD.

741
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,210
So I'm just want to do it.

742
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,190
So I want to find an S
and find a Q out of this.

743
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:49,200
So to get an S--

744
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,550
So let me just start it.

745
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,350
U sigma-- but now
I'm looking for an S.

746
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,530
So what shall I put in now?

747
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,710
I better put in--

748
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,950
if I've got to U
sigma something,

749
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,860
and I want it to
be a symmetric, I

750
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:13,860
should put in U
transpose would do it.

751
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,600
But then if I put
it in U transpose,

752
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,970
I've got to put it in U.
So now I've got U sigma.

753
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,560
U transpose U is the identity.

754
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,470
Then I've got to
get V transpose.

755
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,490
And have I got what
the polar decomposition

756
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:35,080
is asking for in this line?

757
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,300
So, yeah.

758
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,220
What have I got here?

759
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,570
Where's the where's
the S in this?

760
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:46,460
So you see, I took the SVD and I
just put the identity in there,

761
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,080
just shifted things a little.

762
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,860
And now where's the S
that I can read off?

763
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,100
For three, that's an S.
That's a symmetric matrix.

764
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,420
And where's the Q?

765
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,020
Well, I guess we can see
where the Q has to be.

766
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:11,060
It's here, yeah.

767
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, so just by
sticking U transpose U

768
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,120
and putting the
parentheses right,

769
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,860
I recover that decomposition
of a matrix, which

770
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,910
in mechanical engineering
language, is language

771
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,530
tells me that any
strain can be--

772
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,460
which is like stretching
of elastic thing,

773
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:48,160
has a symmetric kind of a
stretch and a internal twist.

774
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,320
Yeah.

775
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,970
So that's good.

776
00:49:51,970 --> 00:50:00,130
Well, this was a 3, 6, 9
boards filled with matrices.

777
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,840
Well, it is 18 0, 6, 5.

778
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,630
So maybe that's all right.

779
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:11,890
But the idea is to use
them on a matrix of data.

780
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,230
And I'll just tell
you the key fact.

781
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:27,240
The key fact-- if I have
a big matrix of data, A,

782
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,000
and if I want to pull
out of that matrix

783
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,790
the important part,
so that's what

784
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:36,280
data science has to be doing.

785
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:42,340
Out of a big matrix, some part
of it is noise, some part of it

786
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,510
is signal.

787
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,060
I'm looking for the most
important part of the signal

788
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,840
here.

789
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,240
So I'm looking for the most
important part of the matrix.

790
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:57,420
In a way, the biggest
numbers, but of course,

791
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,810
I don't look at
individual numbers.

792
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:04,950
So what's the biggest
part of the matrix?

793
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,930
What are the
principal components?

794
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,700
Now we're really getting in--

795
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,140
it could be data.

796
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,060
And we want to do
statistics, or we

797
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,120
want to see what has
high variance, what

798
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:24,240
has low variance, we'll do these
connections with statistics.

799
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,950
But what's the important
part of the matrix?

800
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:33,130
Well, let me look at
U sigma V transpose.

801
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:37,600
Here, yeah, let me look at it.

802
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:43,900
So what's the one most
important part of that matrix?

803
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,950
The right one?

804
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,430
It's a rank one piece.

805
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:50,750
So when I say a part, of course
it's going to be a matrix part.

806
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,900
So the simple matrix
building block

807
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,850
is like a rank one matrix, a
something, something transpose.

808
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,550
And what should I
pull out of that

809
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,890
as being the most
important rank one

810
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,230
matrix that's in that product?

811
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,890
So I'll erase the
1.8 while you think

812
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:16,640
what do I do to pick out the big
deal, the thing that the data

813
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,200
is telling me first.

814
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,360
Well, these are orthonormal.

815
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,740
No one is bigger
than another one.

816
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,580
These are orthonormal, no one
is bigger than another one.

817
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:35,130
But here, I look here, which
is the most important number?

818
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:37,200
Sigma 1.

819
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:37,880
Sigma 1.

820
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,930
So the part I pick out is
this biggest number times

821
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,080
it's row times it's column.

822
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:55,220
So it's u 1 sigma 1 v1 transpose
is the top principal part

823
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,320
of the matrix A.
It's the leading

824
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,700
part of the matrix A.
It's the biggest rank one

825
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,040
part of the matrix is there.

826
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:07,580
So computing those three
guys is the first step

827
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,080
to understanding the data.

828
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:10,580
Yeah.

829
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,920
So that's what's
coming next is--

830
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,230
and I guess tomorrow,
since they moved--

831
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:24,410
MIT declared Tuesday
to be Monday.

832
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,860
They didn't change Wednesday.

833
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:32,450
So I'll see you tomorrow for
the principal components.

834
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,000
Good.
