8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,680
PROFESSOR: So, are
we ready to go?

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,810
Any questions on 18065?

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,540
So it will be, as I said before,
a mixture of linear algebra

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:42,430
and math questions, along with
online using the material.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,240
OK.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,890
So I'm, in this
first week or two,

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,880
reviewing the highlights
of linear algebra.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,240
And I've reached this
point, to remember--

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,560
well, so we--

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,430
I just said two words
about multiplying matrices

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,770
by using column times
row as a way to do it.

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,040
And now, I want
to illustrate that

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,480
by the five key
factorizations of matrices.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
OK.

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,620
So what are they?

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,070
And do you recognize them?

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,780
Everybody uses those letters.

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,710
In fact, some of those
letters, like LU or QR,

26
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,450
would be the most used MATLAB
commands in linear algebra.

27
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,020
So a A equal LU of, maybe--

28
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,360
say something I'll
develop today--

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,310
but it's about elimination.

30
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,300
Solving linear systems.

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,080
So that's always the start
of a linear algebra course.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,260
But it will go fast here.

33
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,510
I just want to show
you a different way

34
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,289
they get to L times
U-- lower triangular

35
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,450
times upper triangular.

36
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,880
Probably you've seen that--

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,610
those triangular matrices.

38
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,330
So do you know what QR is?

39
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,482
What's QR about?

40
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,300
AUDIENCE: Least squares?

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,462
PROFESSOR: Least squares
is the big application,

42
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,110
the factorization.

43
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,335
So what kind of a matrix
gets that letter Q?

44
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,210
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal?

45
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,127
PROFESSOR: Orthogonal.

46
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,190
The columns are orthogonal.

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,220
Often orthonormal.

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,320
So orthogonal means they're
perpendicular to each other.

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,090
And orthonormal means
they're unit vectors.

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:52,710
So that is-- so Q often
represents a matrix

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,830
with orthonormal columns.

52
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,950
So you-- we could
say Gram-Schmidt,

53
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,300
if you want to remember
a couple of old timers

54
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,440
whose algorithm
produces Q and R.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640
How about this one?

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,360
This is really a
central one in math--

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,750
pure math, applied math,
everywhere-- applications.

58
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,030
So S stands for symmetric.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,970
So this is a special
factorization

60
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,340
for symmetric matrices.

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,020
And you can see
that it's symmetric.

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,460
This lambda is the diagonal
eigenvalue matrix--

63
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,850
always lambda for eigenvalues.

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,010
Q is like that Q--

65
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,220
different Q, of course.

66
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,920
That Q you can find
just straight forward

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,690
from Gram-Schmidt.

68
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,110
This Q has the eigenvectors.

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,630
So you don't find eigenvectors
without some extra work.

70
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,130
OK.

71
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,270
So that's eigenvectors.

72
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,770
Yeah.

73
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,380
So that would be
worth expanding.

74
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,670
So here are the eigenvectors
of the matrix S--

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,340
n of them, normalized.

76
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,540
Here are the eigenvalues
lambda 1 to lambda n.

77
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,170
And here are the
eigenvectors now transposed.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,170
So remind me of the
great fact about--

79
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,560
two facts, I guess-- one
fact about the eigenvalues

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,570
and one fact about eigenvectors.

81
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:41,650
This is an important fact
statement in linear algebra.

82
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,120
What do we know about
the eigenvectors?

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,780
Oh well, I guess
I've given it away.

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,310
The eigenvectors are orthogonal.

85
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,230
That's very important.

86
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,310
Makes some matrices-- well,
they're beautiful matrices.

87
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,110
They're the kings
of linear algebra.

88
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,320
Qs are the queens,
in my opinion.

89
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,210
Orthogonal matrices
are the queens,

90
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,270
and symmetric matrices
are the kings.

91
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,630
So these are orthonormal
eigenvectors.

92
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,400
And the key point--

93
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,860
an important point
that's implicit

94
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,140
here-- is, there are n of them.

95
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,430
There is a complete set.

96
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,280
The matrix can be diagonalized.

97
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,050
And those-- well, what's
special about the eigenvalues?

98
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,250
Other matrices could be
Q lambda Q transpose.

99
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,730
But symmetric matrices
are something additional

100
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,375
about lambda.

101
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,500
AUDIENCE: They're all real?

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,330
PROFESSOR: They're all real.

103
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,530
So eigenvalues are real.

104
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,330
And eigenvectors
are orthonormal--

105
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,150
can be chosen orthonormal--
can be chosen,

106
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,380
I guess I have to say.

107
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,040
OK.

108
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,610
Good.

109
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,110
Good.

110
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,630
Good.

111
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,960
Oh, now maybe I'll
use that as an example

112
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,340
of matrix multiplication.

113
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,160
So let me just do that here.

114
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,350
Simple matrix multiplication,
but it makes the point.

115
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,100
So Q lambda Q transpose.

116
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,950
OK.

117
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,730
Well, what was my point
about matrix multiplication?

118
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,140
Let me-- it really
involved two matrices.

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,800
Here, I unfortunately
have three.

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,240
So I'm going to have to squeeze
lambda in with one of the Qs,

121
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,840
to see it nicely
as two matrices.

122
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,560
Shall I just do that?

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,050
Yeah.

124
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,880
Now I've made it two matrices.

125
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,350
That was easy.

126
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,160
OK.

127
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,590
Now what's the rule?

128
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,000
In the first notes, this
was A and this was B.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
And when you multiply
two matrices,

130
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:54,430
the rule is, this is
columns of Q lambda times

131
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,610
rows of Q transpose.

132
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,060
I'm multiplying columns by rows.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,330
And so it's a column
vector times a row vector,

134
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,820
and that gives us a matrix.

135
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,450
So each-- and it's
a special matrix.

136
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,750
So this is our column.

137
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,330
This is a row.

138
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:22,510
And when I multiply n by 1 times
1 by n, I get an n by n matrix.

139
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,340
And it's pretty special.

140
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,250
And what is the
special fact about I'm

141
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,530
sort of recalling
from last time.

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,890
What's special about
a column times a row?

143
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,630
It's rank is special.

144
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,440
It's rank is 1.

145
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,910
It's column space-- well, the
only column around is this one.

146
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,630
So all columns are
multiples of this guy.

147
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,410
All rows are
multiples of this guy,

148
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,450
as we could see from an example.

149
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,160
Shall I just do an example?

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,490
1, 2 times 3, 4, to
take a random example.

151
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,020
So that would give
us 3, 4, 6, 8.

152
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,630
And sure enough, the columns
are multiples of 1, 2.

153
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,270
The rows are multiples of 3, 4.

154
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,610
And the rank is 1.

155
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,110
OK.

156
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,360
So those are the
building blocks.

157
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,850
Now I want to build something.

158
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,720
So here we go.

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,310
So this is a sum of rank 1.

160
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,100
Sum of rank 1.

161
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,970
Sum of column times row.

162
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,210
So I take column 1 times row 1.

163
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,460
That's my first
thing in the sum.

164
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,840
So column 1 of that.

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
So you see I had
to sneak the lambda

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,660
to have just two factors.

167
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,840
So what's column 1 of Q lambda?

168
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,830
That's a good question.

169
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,080
So column 1 of Q is Q1--

170
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,120
the first eigenvector.

171
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,400
But now, I am multiplying
by this diagonal matrix.

172
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,360
Do you see in your mind what's
the first column of Q lambda?

173
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,290
Just think about that a second.

174
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:23,200
So here's-- we can steal any
little corner for a matrix.

175
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,910
So here's q1, and the
rest of the columns.

176
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,210
And then here is lambda 1.

177
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,440
And that's Q lambda.

178
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,600
So I'm putting those together.

179
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,480
And I'm asking, what's the
first column of the answer?

180
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,510
Can you see how that works?

181
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,880
AUDIENCE: q1 lambda 1?

182
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,983
PROFESSOR: It's... sorry?.

183
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:44,900
AUDIENCE: q1 lambda 1?

184
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,940
PROFESSOR: q1 lambda 1.

185
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,900
Exactly.

186
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,660
That lambda 1 will multiply q1.

187
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,250
These other lambdas
multiplied later columns.

188
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,980
So the first column
is lambda 1 times q1.

189
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,480
Right.

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,880
So it's the first
guy, lambda 1, q1.

191
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,820
And then the first row of
this will be q1 transpose.

192
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,770
That's the first guy
in our sum of n things.

193
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,710
And let me put the next
one and the last one.

194
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:20,200
Lambda 2, q2, q2 transpose.

195
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,960
And lambda n, qn, qn transpose.

196
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,320
That's really a nice
right way to write

197
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,300
to breakup the product,
q lambda q transpose.

198
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,650
This is called the
spectral theorem.

199
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,700
So that's the symmetric-- that's
S. That's S there, is that.

200
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,370
So that's-- we've broken
up S into rank 1 pieces.

201
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,750
That's like a constant theme.

202
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,290
And these rank 1 pieces are
quite special because they're

203
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,700
symmetric.

204
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,790
Q1q1 transpose
will be symmetric.

205
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,780
And oh, so can we--

206
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,280
so let's just-- I follow the
rule for multiplying matrices.

207
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,350
But maybe I could just check
that it's the right thing--

208
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,350
that it came out right.

209
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,940
So what do I mean by checking?

210
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,350
I guess I'll just
check about S times q1.

211
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,810
So look at S--

212
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,760
this thing-- times the first
eigenvector, and what do I get?

213
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,990
OK.

214
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,170
So you'll like this.

215
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,400
I've split up S into a
sum of rank 1 pieces.

216
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,870
And that splitting is--

217
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,620
you see it all over.

218
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,370
It's really showing you what the
pieces of the symmetric matrix

219
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,150
are.

220
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,010
And now I'm just going
to check that that's

221
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,530
a correct formula for S,
so I'll multiply it by q1.

222
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,780
And I'm hoping to
get the right thing.

223
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,790
And what do I actually get?

224
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,160
If I multiply this
whole business times q1,

225
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,310
I get lambda 1,
q1, q1 transpose--

226
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,400
that's the first
guy times my q1--

227
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,980
plus-- right?

228
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,260
I'm multiplying S by q1, and
this first term gave me that.

229
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,010
And what does the
next term give me?

230
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,010
Put me out of my misery here.

231
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,310
I'm looking for this thing
to simplify like mad.

232
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,830
OK.

233
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,150
So what's the second term?

234
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,833
When I multiply this guy
by q1, what do I get?

235
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,760
AUDIENCE: Zero.

236
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,470
PROFESSOR: Zero.

237
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,580
That's right.

238
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,000
That's what we want.

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,640
And when I multiply
the last guy by q1,

240
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,090
I get zero, because
the qs are orthogonal.

241
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,060
So this is all I get.

242
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,790
And then-- so, I don't
need this plus anymore.

243
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,020
That's it.

244
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,290
And then what can
I do to improve

245
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:18,060
that little somewhat repetitive
formula for the answer?

246
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,920
What do I want to do finally?

247
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,430
I want to remember that
the qs are normalized.

248
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,090
They're unit vectors.

249
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,652
So what does that tell me here?

250
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,610
AUDIENCE: Q1 transpose.

251
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,180
PROFESSOR: Q1
transpose times q1.

252
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,170
This is just 1.

253
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,210
It's-- that's what
normalized means--

254
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:41,630
that the length
squared is the length--

255
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,880
the length of the
vector squared.

256
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,900
And it's 1.

257
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,750
So I can cancel that term.

258
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,370
And I'm getting
the right answer.

259
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,850
That's all-- that's
all this was about.

260
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,600
I was just checking and wanted
to see how it would fall out.

261
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,100
And it falls right
out that this formula

262
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,250
is the correct matrix
S, because it's

263
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,210
got the right eigenvectors, qs.

264
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,460
And it's got the right
eigenvalues lambdas.

265
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,390
So it's gotta be the right
matrix S. Is that OK?

266
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:24,830
That's like a first
example to see how this--

267
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,680
splitting into rank 1s--

268
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,400
gives you back what you
expect easily enough.

269
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,200
It gives you the
information you expect.

270
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,700
OK.

271
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,940
So that's the symmetric
eigenvalue picture

272
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,470
for symmetric matrices.

273
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,360
And we'll see it again.

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,410
It's-- well, all five of
these are big, are important.

275
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,660
I don't know if
you know this one,

276
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,090
but it's going to be a
foundational factorization

277
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,220
for this course and for
all of data science.

278
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,130
Do you know its name?

279
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,920
So, what does it
mean, first of all?

280
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,950
Just a comment on
this, and then we'll

281
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,450
save it for a couple of weeks.

282
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,130
So this view is actually
an orthogonal matrix.

283
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,870
And so is V. So it has
two orthogonal matrices.

284
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,230
So that's why people
call them U and V

285
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,470
rather than Q1 and Q2, which
was too much to get subscript.

286
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,210
So orthogonal times
diagonal times orthogonal.

287
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:45,880
And we'd say, orthogonal,
diagonal, orthogonal.

288
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,860
And 18.06 would, as of
now, reach this topic

289
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,710
because it's jumped
up in importance.

290
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,640
And it's called?

291
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,265
AUDIENCE: Singular
value decomposition.

292
00:15:57,265 --> 00:16:00,210
PROFESSOR: Singular
value decomposition.

293
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,910
Well, those are long words, so
everybody calls it the SVD--

294
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,470
the singular value
decomposition.

295
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:15,210
The point is it works
for every matrix--

296
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,650
rectangular matrices.

297
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,690
There's no issue
of, does it have

298
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,630
enough eigenvectors or not?

299
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,730
That's an issue here.

300
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,320
Well, it's an issue here.

301
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,910
Not every matrix has got enough
eigenvectors to make that work.

302
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,820
Every matrix that one
works because instead

303
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,780
of one set of
vectors it's got two

304
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,330
matrices-- two different
sets of singular vectors.

305
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,470
Oh, we'll see that.

306
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,900
That's important.

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,420
OK.

308
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,490
So that's really
a quick overview

309
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,210
of fundamental factorizations.

310
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,970
And I'd like to say just
another word about elimination,

311
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,540
A equal LU, and then
we'll leave it alone.

312
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,609
So elimination.

313
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:12,109
Yeah.

314
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:20,079
Do you remember that first
beginning of linear algebra,

315
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,290
when you're solving ax equal b?

316
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,460
You do these row operations.

317
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,990
Can I just-- what I want to say
is, all those row operations

318
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,330
that you do are perfectly
expressed by L times U.

319
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,000
And so that's a
key point in 18.06,

320
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,670
but I have a different
way to look at it.

321
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,170
So that's what I
wanted to show you.

322
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,050
I have a--

323
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,430
I want to show you a sum of
rank 1's, or row times column.

324
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,020
It fits in today.

325
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:02,230
So I'd just like to see, why
does a matrix invertible--

326
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,780
this is a square
matrix, now invertible.

327
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,260
And it factors-- if all
goes well with elimination

328
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,270
and the pivots are non-zero--

329
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,140
it factors into lower triangular
times upper triangular.

330
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,260
So that's a key step that is--

331
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,500
that MATLAB would
do with a lu of A--

332
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,970
would produce those two factors.

333
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,890
Now I want to do them
in a column times row

334
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:39,760
way, which I just realized
late, was a neat way to do it.

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,850
So can I take a matrix
and do elimination?

336
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,690
How big a matrix shall I take?

337
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,140
2 by 2 [INAUDIBLE].

338
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,250
3 by 3 Somebody's not
convinced totally by 2 by 2

339
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,860
Let me do it 2 by 2 and then
if you want-- if you really

340
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,140
want a 3 by 3 do it.

341
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,640
OK.

342
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,930
Here's 2 by 2 2, 4, 3, 7.

343
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,760
How's that?

344
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,260
OK.

345
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,650
So what is-- yeah.

346
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,900
So let's remember
what elimination does.

347
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:31,430
It subtracts a multiple
of that row from that one,

348
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,420
to get to 2, 3.

349
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,780
And the multiple is 2.

350
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,910
So it knocks out the 4.

351
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,140
Two 3's are 6.

352
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,820
So it leaves a 1.

353
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,590
And we're-- oh, yeah.

354
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,930
Thanks for allowing
me to do 2 by 2.

355
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,520
I've already done it now.

356
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,720
I've reached U. So
here's A. And here's U--

357
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,290
the upper triangular guy with
the pivots on the diagonal.

358
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:01,920
And then the
question is, express

359
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,910
that step in matrix language.

360
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,440
And the right answer is l
times U. So the right answer

361
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,970
is that this A is--

362
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,660
so I'll just erase
that letter U--

363
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,430
is l times U. So what is l?

364
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,130
L is the lower triangular guy.

365
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,470
And it has there the
number that you used here.

366
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,490
And what was that?

367
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,790
I subtracted 2 of
that row from this.

368
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,450
So I want a 2 there.

369
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,170
So that would be--

370
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,090
I would call that a multiplier.

371
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,850
I multiplied row 1 by 2.

372
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,280
Subtracted to get that 0.

373
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,410
And for a 2 by 2
example, I was finished.

374
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:57,910
OK.

375
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,810
Now I want to see this--

376
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,770
so there is l times
U. It happened.

377
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,770
Right.

378
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:10,470
I would like to see how l
times U comes out of this row--

379
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,590
column times row.

380
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,370
So let me start--

381
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,980
let me think again.

382
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,490
So really the point
of elimination--

383
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,220
why did we do this
in the first place?

384
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,313
Because here we had
two coupled equations.

385
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:31,480
There were coupled together.

386
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,660
We couldn't solve
them instantly.

387
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,250
That step of elimination
reduced me to--

388
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,840
down here in this corner--

389
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,820
one equation, that I've
eliminated the first unknown x

390
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,440
from the second equation.

391
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,140
So the second equation is 0x
plus 1y equal right hand side.

392
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,800
And I solve it immediately.

393
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
OK.

394
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,680
So how did I get to
that 1 by 1 problem,

395
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,480
with these guys removed?

396
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,822
Well-- yeah.

397
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,130
I'll just write-- can
I write here the--

398
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,500
my parallel way to think of it?

399
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,960
2 by 2 is pretty small, I admit.

400
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,620
OK.

401
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,260
So I start with 2, 3, 4, 7.

402
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,790
I want to split it into--

403
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:30,770
I want to get the first row
and column in one piece.

404
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,780
Something goes there.

405
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,610
And the other piece
is something there.

406
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,350
OK.

407
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,750
That's what
elimination has done.

408
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,210
It's taken the original matrix.

409
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,440
It's split-- these
are both rank 1.

410
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,030
So let's just--
first of all, you

411
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,280
could tell me what goes in that
blank space in the first rank 1

412
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,790
matrix.

413
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,120
So what-- can I
say this in words?

414
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,630
The first stage of
elimination pulls off from A--

415
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,090
so A is some big matrix.

416
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,070
It pulls off from A. It takes
account of the first column

417
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,540
and row.

418
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,910
So it writes A as--

419
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:33,560
here we go-- as a first
column, say column

420
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:40,100
1, row 1, plus the easy part.

421
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,740
The easy part will be a
matrix with all zeros there--

422
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,090
all zeros there.

423
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,100
And here I have a 2.

424
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,740
Can I call it a 2?

425
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,690
This is my way now
to think about what

426
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,670
elimination is really doing.

427
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,400
It's starting with
an n by n matrix.

428
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,580
It's pulling off
a rank 1 matrix,

429
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,140
which gets that column
and that row correct.

430
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,660
And it gets whatever
it has in here.

431
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,400
And then the rest of
what's in there is A2.

432
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
Do you see that
we've done that here?

433
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,270
The first step got the first
row and column correct.

434
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,400
And if it's rank 1,
what number goes there?

435
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,140
AUDIENCE: 6.

436
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,928
PROFESSOR: 6.

437
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:29,269
6 for there.

438
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,340
And then this is the rest.

439
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,900
This is what we have, one
size smaller to work on.

440
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,380
And it looks like it was 7.

441
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,600
6 has been used.

442
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,340
So it's a 1.

443
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:52,130
That's really-- I want to
think of this rank 1 matrix

444
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,610
as the first column of l
times the first row of u.

445
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,670
And then this guy
is the second column

446
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,110
of l times the second row of u.

447
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,270
OK.

448
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,820
I haven't presented as
proof in a class before.

449
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,560
And for 2 by 2, it's
looking like overkill to me.

450
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,610
I mean, why?

451
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,710
You don't have to do
all that deep thinking

452
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,540
to get the pieces.

453
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,230
But my idea is that it
gives the breakdown.

454
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,370
And this, of course,
is, by our column times

455
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,140
row rule, that's LU.

456
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,510
So we're starting with A, and
we're breaking it up into LU,

457
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,890
where lu--

458
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,140
the first piece of lu--

459
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,920
is the first column times row.

460
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,710
And then the next pieces
are the rest of the matrix.

461
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,240
And those get broken down-- the
next stage of elimination would

462
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,020
break--

463
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,650
if I had a 3 by 3,
this stage peeled off

464
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,540
the first column and row--

465
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,790
then the next stage would
peel off the second--

466
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,970
the new second column and row.

467
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,370
And the third stage would have
the third column and row--

468
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,500
just the last pivot does
this make any sense to you?

469
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,000
You could email me and
say it's not that great.

470
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,420
But I think it's--

471
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:39,410
to see that the final result of
elimination is l times u is--

472
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:45,720
there's a little magic in
seeing what you're doing.

473
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,380
And I think this is a way
to see what you're doing--

474
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,970
that you're peeling
off a first part

475
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,790
to leave a second
part like that.

476
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,250
Then the second part,
you would peel off

477
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,970
the second column
times the second row,

478
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,030
maybe divide by the
pivot to make it correct.

479
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,020
And that would put something
in the rest of the box.

480
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,640
And then A3 would be
the rest of that box.

481
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,420
OK.

482
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,430
I'm stopping here.

483
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm glad you let me do 2 by
2, since I see that 3 by 3

484
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,840
would have ruined the day.

485
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,370
Yeah.

486
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,245
OK.

487
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,450
A question, or let me
pause for a minute.

488
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,770
So I've talked about
these factorizations.

489
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,200
This one we won't see again.

490
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,440
This one we will see, big time.

491
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,510
And this one we will.

492
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,770
And this one we will.

493
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,270
Yeah.

494
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,510
2, 3 and 5 are the
ones that we're really

495
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,820
going to see a lot of.

496
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,250
Questions or thoughts or--

497
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,450
OK.

498
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,760
I guess I want to tell you
now to complete today's--

499
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,100
moving forward in this subject--

500
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,070
the fundamental theorem
of linear algebra--

501
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,420
the fundamental theorem
of linear algebra.

502
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,920
OK.

503
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,890
Ready for that?

504
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,590
Or you may have seen it
already, because it's

505
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,970
like the highlight
of this subject--

506
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,510
of the basic ideas
in this subject.

507
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,010
Right.

508
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,300
And then maybe I can--

509
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,010
after I tell you that theorem--

510
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,560
people around the world send
me homework problems to do.

511
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,680
Now, you would think any
sensible professor would never

512
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
do those problems.

513
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,190
He would say, it's your problem.

514
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:43,990
But I get carried away and
I solve them sometimes.

515
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,110
So one came from
India last week,

516
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,290
and it involved the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra.

517
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,970
Whoever teaching it there
really was on the ball.

518
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,560
And well, I'll tell
you that problem

519
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,160
after the fundamental theorem.

520
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,760
OK.

521
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,600
Fundamental theorem.

522
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,410
It's about four sub spaces.

523
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,720
So I invented the name four
fundamental sub spaces.

524
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,390
So can I list the
four sub places?

525
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,830
Fundamental sub spaces.

526
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,980
Well, we know one
of them already.

527
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:29,670
The column space--
so, for a matrix.

528
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,060
We are given a matrix A--

529
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,090
that's m by n of rank r.

530
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,600
That's our normal
starting point.

531
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,220
So what are those
four sub spaces,

532
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,540
and how are they related?

533
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,860
And what's their dimension?

534
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,830
And what-- those are key facts.

535
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,330
OK.

536
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,010
We already know
the column space--

537
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,780
column space of a matrix.

538
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,760
And actually, we already know
the row space of a matrix.

539
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,770
And we have the
notation for that,

540
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:13,430
column space of A transpose.

541
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,010
And what is the dimension--

542
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,410
so that was the key point
in the first lecture.

543
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,300
Anybody who missed
the first lecture,

544
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:28,880
should go back to
the notes of 1.1

545
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,950
for the thinking that goes
into the dimension equals what?

546
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,580
Which of those three
numbers do I want to--

547
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,530
is the dimension of
the column space?

548
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,990
R. And what can I say
about r, right away,

549
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,950
compared to m and n?

550
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,733
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

551
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:50,400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

552
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,320
Less or equal.

553
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,120
r couldn't-- I couldn't have
more independent columns than I

554
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,760
have columns.

555
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,260
So I've got n columns.

556
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,890
So r of them are independent.

557
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,120
So r is somewhere, less or
equal-- hopefully equal to n.

558
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
What about the dimension
of the row space?

559
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,116
How many independent
rows has the matrix got?

560
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:15,616
AUDIENCE: R.

561
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:16,710
PROFESSOR: R. Thank you.

562
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:23,910
That's the great fact
with a new proof last time

563
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,910
in section 1.1--

564
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,670
that those have the same
dimension, same dimension.

565
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,700
Which is-- you think, oh, OK.

566
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,680
You look at a simple example.

567
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,760
It's true.

568
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,760
But if you're given a
matrix that's 50 by 100,

569
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,580
really the fact that
those 100 columns

570
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,450
have the same number of
independent ones as those 50

571
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,110
row--

572
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,840
that's like great.

573
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,470
OK.

574
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,700
Now the other spaces
are the null space

575
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,820
of the matrix, N of A.

576
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,250
And just to make everything
naturally symmetric,

577
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,650
the null space of A transpose.

578
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,600
Those are the last two.

579
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,020
Those are the four fundamental
sub spaces, which you've seen.

580
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,150
And they're even on the cover
of the linear algebra textbook.

581
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,680
OK.

582
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,822
So what's the null space?

583
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,640
AUDIENCE: It's the
set of [INAUDIBLE]..

584
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,920
PROFESSOR: It's the
set of solutions to Ax

585
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,510
equals 0, right.

586
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:48,130
Null space is all
solutions to Ax equal 0.

587
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,050
So the null space has vector--

588
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,720
these vectors in it-- the x's.

589
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,410
The null space isn't
taken from the matrix.

590
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,100
The row space and the
column space-- those numbers

591
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,170
are sitting in the matrix.

592
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,100
The null space, and the
null space of A transpose,

593
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,930
are solutions to--

594
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,670
the word null is reflecting
the fact that that's a 0.

595
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,710
And that's what
makes it a space.

596
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,210
Now can you just--

597
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,890
let me just ask
you to think again.

598
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,580
What's implied when I say--

599
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,480
when I use the word space--

600
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,645
a space of vectors?

601
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,020
AUDIENCE: Closed
under addition--

602
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,040
PROFESSOR: I can add--

603
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,020
yeah.

604
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:37,930
So I can do the most important
operations of linear algebra

605
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,460
in that space.

606
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,120
I can add two vectors.

607
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,970
Here, let me just add them.

608
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,760
So here I'll have
a vector x, and let

609
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,960
me say another one, a vector y.

610
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,140
Then, I do addition.

611
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,970
I follow the rules.

612
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,830
I see that this can be written
as Ax plus y is 0 plus 0.

613
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,340
So what have I learned?

614
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,090
I've learned that if x
is in the null space,

615
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,750
and y is in the null
space, then x plus y.

616
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,659
So the null space is,
as you said, closed,

617
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,449
meaning I don't go outside it.

618
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,929
If x is in it, and y is in
it, then the sum is in it.

619
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:27,429
And similarly, from Ax equals
0, I get to A times cx equals 0.

620
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,420
Just multiply by
c-- by a number c.

621
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:33,460
So those two facts--

622
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,210
that means I can
do linear algebra.

623
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,760
I can multiply by numbers.

624
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,960
And I can add.

625
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,199
In other words, I can
take linear combinations.

626
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,480
That's what you do with vectors.

627
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,550
And the point is, if I do it--

628
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,719
if I take combinations
of two null space guys,

629
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,310
I'm still in the null space.

630
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,300
OK.

631
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,350
So that's the point
of the null space.

632
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:06,800
And-- well now-- so now part
of the fundamental theorem

633
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,630
is to figure out how many
independent vectors are

634
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,680
in the null space.

635
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,490
How many solutions--
independent solutions--

636
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,260
does that system
of equations have?

637
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,380
So that would be the dimension.

638
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,070
And I have to ask
you what it is.

639
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,080
Let me draw a
picture, while you're

640
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,180
thinking about those spaces.

641
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,710
It's fantastic to have these
beautiful clean boards.

642
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,210
OK.

643
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,870
So here's my picture
of the row space.

644
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,680
Row-- that's the column
space of A transpose.

645
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:58,265
And here's my picture of
the null space, N of A.

646
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:01,085
And that's the solutions
to Ax equals 0.

647
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,650
And why have I put
these two together,

648
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,910
and these two together?

649
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:17,120
So-- and the other pair will
be the column space, C of A.

650
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:26,172
and the null space
of A transpose.

651
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:27,380
So there are the four spaces.

652
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:33,380
Their relationship is
the fundamental theorem

653
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,630
of linear algebra.

654
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,800
So first of all, what--

655
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,285
so I have an m by n matrix.

656
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,360
So that tells me that my row--

657
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,550
a typical row has n
components, right?

658
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,250
I look at an m by n matrix.

659
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,805
Let's do a 2 by 3 matrix.

660
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,890
So if I look at the
row space, this is m.

661
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,380
And this is n.

662
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,270
So I see three--

663
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,280
the rows have length three.

664
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,950
And of course, they
multiply the x's,

665
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,030
which also have the
length three, x1, x2, x3.

666
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,220
That's why these are
together, because they're

667
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,650
both in n dimensional space.

668
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,250
Then why are these together?

669
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,540
Because the columns are
in two dimensional space,

670
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,050
for this example.

671
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,350
And the null space
of A transpose

672
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:49,390
would be just two components,
like y1 and y2, to give 0s.

673
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,580
So do you see that this is R--

674
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,730
these guys are in Rn?

675
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,980
So that's the first--

676
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,930
get things straight.

677
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:02,770
Two spaces in Rn,
two spaces in Rm.

678
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,570
Now, what am I going to
ask about these spaces?

679
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,430
I guess I've already
started asking

680
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,610
and didn't wait for an answer.

681
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,270
Their dimension.

682
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:24,690
So this has dimension R.
And what's the dimension--

683
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:31,450
how many-- this is
really such a key fact.

684
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:37,880
If I have m equations,
Ax equals 0.

685
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,630
And if R of those
equations are independent,

686
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,730
how many solutions?

687
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,500
So the dimension
of this space is

688
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,950
going to tell me
how many solutions

689
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,360
to Ax in two m
equations, but really

690
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:02,610
only are genuine independent
equations in this system Ax

691
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,870
equals 0.

692
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,840
How many?

693
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,650
So can I ask the question again?

694
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,570
And I want the answer in terms
of m, and n, and R. So I have--

695
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,610
I really have R equations.

696
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,680
If I look at Ax
equals 0, it looks

697
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,660
like m separate equations.

698
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,020
But m minus R--

699
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,210
of those-- are just copies
or combinations of others.

700
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:30,180
So there are
independent equations.

701
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,648
So what's-- how many have I got?

702
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:35,483
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

703
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,900
PROFESSOR: And And that's what
I'm going to write in here.

704
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,740
So-- yeah.

705
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,970
So x has n components.

706
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:51,490
And there are real
active equations

707
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,680
that they have to satisfy.

708
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,282
And that leaves n minus
R. That's the key point.

709
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:04,790
That's the key point that
there are n components of x--

710
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,610
n unknowns-- n unknowns.

711
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,020
And there are R constraints--

712
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,170
independent constraints.

713
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,270
So those n get--

714
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,960
if I want to satisfy those
constraints that knocks out

715
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,050
dimension R, and leaves
n minus R. So that's

716
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,920
the dimension here.

717
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,960
And the beauty of the count is
that those two numbers add up

718
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,070
to n.

719
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,110
Everybody's accounted for.

720
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,590
Every vector has a
piece in the row space

721
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,450
and a piece and the null space.

722
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,680
And that's-- those two pieces
give you back the vector.

723
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,650
Do you see that?

724
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,300
That's just nice, that the
numbers come out right.

725
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,560
And of course, they come
out right here, too.

726
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,200
You could say, just
transpose the matrix

727
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,660
and write it-- write
the same thing again.

728
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,580
What's the dimension
of the column space?

729
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:06,130
Equals?

730
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,370
The other column space in
the matrix has dimension--

731
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,360
AUDIENCE: R.

732
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,190
PROFESSOR: R. Right.

733
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,870
And the row-- this guy is left
out of some linear algebra

734
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,660
books, as if it doesn't belong.

735
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,610
But isn't it clear that
without it, everything

736
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,050
is only three quarters done?

737
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,820
We have to have this guy.

738
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,526
And its dimension is

739
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,280
AUDIENCE: M minus R.

740
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,580
PROFESSOR: M minus R. Yeah.

741
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,780
That count is just,
for A transpose, what

742
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,390
this count was for A. Yeah.

743
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:50,120
So we've got those dimensions,
R and n minus R, R and m

744
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,830
minus R. Yeah.

745
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,780
You'll have known
this, but we need

746
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:05,070
to see it once again in 2018,
before we start using it.

747
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,980
Now is that the
fundamental theorem?

748
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,040
Is that all to it there is?

749
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,330
No.

750
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,910
There is another piece to
the fundamental theorem,

751
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,170
which is, sort of you
could say, the geometry.

752
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,890
Here I have a sub space.

753
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:26,630
Here I have a subspace of
this big n dimensional space.

754
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,010
So I visualize those sub spaces
as some kind of a plane--

755
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:36,840
an R dimensional plane- and an
n minus R dimensional plane.

756
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,970
And I want to see how are
those two planes connected.

757
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,050
How are those two
planes connected?

758
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,240
And let me get a piece of the--

759
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,460
blank piece of the board
to remember the final step.

760
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,350
Right.

761
00:42:53,350 --> 00:43:02,860
So we've got dimensions r and n
minus r, and then over here r,

762
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,470
and m minus r.

763
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:05,970
OK.

764
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,310
And this is for the rows.

765
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,590
This is for the null space.

766
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,400
So this has the rows in it.

767
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,540
This has the null--

768
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,210
the solutions to Ax equals 0.

769
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:23,850
What is the beautiful geometry--

770
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,005
how do you visualize
those two spaces?

771
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:30,880
How do you visualize?

772
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,445
Let me take an example.

773
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:39,250
Let A be 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 8.

774
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,380
Sorry about that.

775
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,980
That's kind of a--

776
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,765
you see it hoked up example.

777
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:49,480
So this is 2 by 3.

778
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,250
So there n is 3.

779
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,440
What's in the null
space of this matrix?

780
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:04,660
Can you see a vector
that solves Ax equals 0?

781
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,780
And in fact, how
many will there be?

782
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,150
What's-- yeah, what's
r for this matrix?

783
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,910
Just tell me all the good stuff.

784
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:20,110
For that example, m is
2, n is 3, and r is--

785
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,010
AUDIENCE: 1.

786
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,260
PROFESSOR: 1.

787
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,780
Everybody sees 1 for the rank?

788
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,060
The rows are dependent.

789
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,300
There's only one
independent row.

790
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,980
The columns are dependent.

791
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,910
There's only-- every column
is a multiple of 1, 2.

792
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,120
It's a rank 1 matrix.

793
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:38,700
OK.

794
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:45,640
What about its-- so its
row space has dimension--

795
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,140
AUDIENCE: 1.

796
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,250
PROFESSOR: 1.

797
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,760
And it's null space
has dimension--

798
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,030
AUDIENCE: 2.

799
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,390
PROFESSOR: 2 So, cause
n minus r will be 2.

800
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,950
So I'm looking for a couple
of vectors that both give 0.

801
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:02,910
I believe there--

802
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,670
I think I've only got one
independent row there.

803
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:10,910
So I should be able to
find two different vectors

804
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:17,180
that solve Ax equals 0.

805
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,630
So what what's the
solution to Ax equals 0?

806
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,010
AUDIENCE: 0 minus 2, 1.

807
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,020
PROFESSOR: 0 minus 2, 1.

808
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,070
Yeah, that works.

809
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,280
And what's an
independent solution?

810
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,700
AUDIENCE: 4, 0, negative 1?

811
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,180
PROFESSOR: 4, 0--
don't throw me off--

812
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,290
4, 0 and--

813
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,040
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

814
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,480
PROFESSOR: Minus 1.

815
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,140
Yeah.

816
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,080
That looks good.

817
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,220
That looks good.

818
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,980
And then the claim is
that every solution would

819
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,390
be a combination of those two.

820
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,930
And this is how many there are.

821
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,240
And now, it's the
geometry I'm completing.

822
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,700
So we have two minutes
left in this lecture.

823
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,380
You just have to tell me how--

824
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,060
what's the relation between
these guys in the row space,

825
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,780
and that guy in the null space?

826
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,350
What's the relation
between the rows of A,

827
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:15,200
the solutions to Ax equals 0?

828
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,960
Between-- if you see it-- if
you saw that vector and that

829
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,710
vector--

830
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,070
well, A times x is 0.

831
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,470
So what does that tell us?

832
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,570
What do we see for the
relation between 1, 2, 4, and 0

833
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,627
minus 2, 1.

834
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:31,460
AUDIENCE: Orthogonal

835
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,752
PROFESSOR: They are orthogonal.

836
00:46:32,752 --> 00:46:33,560
Terrific.

837
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,550
Yes.

838
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,985
Orthogonal I test by the
dot product, 0 minus 4,

839
00:46:37,985 --> 00:46:39,840
4, add to 0.

840
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,340
Yes.

841
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:46,280
So the-- and that's a
completely general fact.

842
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,420
When I look at Ax equals
0, it's telling me

843
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,250
that x is orthogonal
to the rows.

844
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,450
Do you see that?

845
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,380
Just to put it in again here.

846
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:03,080
If I look at Ax, A
has a bunch of rows.

847
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,480
X has one column.

848
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,590
And I get 0.

849
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,135
That's the point
of the null space.

850
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:17,600
And that equation is just
saying that row 1 is orthogonal,

851
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,750
because that's the dot
product of row 1 with x.

852
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,550
So here is row 1, row 2,
row 3, and row 4 with x.

853
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,360
The rows with x--

854
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,920
and I get 0s.

855
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:36,310
So the point is then, these two
spaces are at 90 degree angles.

856
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:41,380
That's really a neat picture
of the four sub spaces.

857
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,990
And these two are
for the same reason--

858
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,550
at 90 degree angles--

859
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,900
off in m dimensional space.

860
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,220
So this is the fundamental
theorem of linear algebra--

861
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,670
to see that the
dimensions come out right,

862
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,160
and the geometry
comes out right.

863
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,670
Yeah.

864
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,950
And then, now, next time--

865
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,140
following the notes-- and
I have a few more copies

866
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:11,810
of the one hand out.

867
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:18,610
We'll move on quickly next week
to eigenvalues and positive

868
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,980
definite matrices.

869
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,650
Good this is really
linear algebra moving on.
