8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,340
GILBERT STRANG: So last time
was orthogonal matrices--

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,995
Q. And this time is
symmetric matrices, S.

10
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:37,620
So we're really talking about
the best matrices of all.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,620
Well, I'll start with any square
matrix and about eigenvectors.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,130
But you've heard of
eigenvectors more than once--

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,540
more than twice--

14
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,580
more than 10 times, probably.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,690
OK.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,270
So eigenvectors.

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,440
And then, let's be sure we
know why they're useful,

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,820
and maybe compute one or two.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,910
But then we'll move
to symmetric matrices

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,260
and what is special about those.

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,060
And then, even more
special and more important

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,350
will be positive definite
symmetric matrices--

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,280
so that when I say, positive
definite, I mean symmetric.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,850
So start with A. Next comes
S. Then come the special S--

25
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,190
special symmetric
matrices that have

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,950
this extra positive
definite property.

27
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,270
OK.

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,360
So start with A.
So an eigenvector--

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,470
if I multiply A by
x, I get some vector.

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:51,010
And sometimes, if x is
especially chosen well,

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,988
Ax comes out in the
same direction as x.

32
00:01:55,988 --> 00:02:01,830
Ax comes out some
number times x.

33
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,530
So there are-- normally,
there would be,

34
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,120
for an n by n matrix--

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:13,040
so let's say A is n by n today.

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,910
Normally, if we
live right, there

37
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,260
will be n different
independent vectors--

38
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,740
x eigenvectors-- that have
this special property.

39
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,680
And we can compute them
by hand if n is 2 or 3--

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,140
2, mostly.

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,920
But the computation of
the x's and the lambdas--

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,230
so this is for i
equal 1 up to n,

43
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,920
if I use this sort
of math shorthand--

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,880
that I have n of
these almost always.

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,190
And my first question is,
what are they good for?

46
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,840
Why does course after course
introduce eigenvectors?

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,440
And to me the key property is
seen by looking at A squared.

48
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,910
So let me look at A squared.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,690
So it's another n by n matrix.

50
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,140
And we would ask, suppose
we know these guys?

51
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,890
Suppose we've found
those somehow.

52
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,410
What about A squared?

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,020
Is x an eigenvector
of A squared also?

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,310
Well, the way to find out is
to multiply A squared by x,

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,390
and see what happens.

56
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,640
Do you see what's
going to happen here?

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:50,960
This is A times Ax,
which is A times--

58
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,370
Ax is lambda x--

59
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,150
and now what do I do now?

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,150
Because I'm shooting
for the answer yes.

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,300
X is an eigenvector
of A squared also.

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,250
So what do I do?

63
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,010
That number-- that
lambda is just a number.

64
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,930
I can put it anywhere I like.

65
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,210
So I can put it out front.

66
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,170
And then I have Ax, which is?

67
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,395
AUDIENCE: Lambda x.

68
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,000
GILBERT STRANG: Lambda x.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Thanks.

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,800
So I have another lambda x.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
So there's lambda squared x.

72
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,870
So I learned the
crucial thing here--

73
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,270
that x is also an
eigenvector of A squared,

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,700
and the eigenvalue
is lambda squared.

75
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,710
And of course, I can keep going.

76
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,025
So A to the nth--

77
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:42,580
x is lambda to the nth x.

78
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,660
We have found the right vectors
for that particular matrix A.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,970
What about A inverse x?

80
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,230
That will be-- if
everything is good--

81
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,040
1 over lambda x.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,750
Well, yeah.

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,420
So anytime I write
1 over lambda,

84
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,810
my mind says, you
gotta make some comment

85
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,680
on the special case where
it doesn't work, which is?

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,405
AUDIENCE: Lambda
is not equal to 0.

87
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,280
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

88
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,720
If lambda is not 0, I'm golden.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,590
If lambda is 0, it
doesn't look good.

90
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,137
And what's happening
if lambda is 0?

91
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:27,470
AUDIENCE: A inverse [INAUDIBLE].

92
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,428
GILBERT STRANG: A doesn't
even have an inverse.

93
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,010
If lambda was 0--

94
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,620
which it could be--

95
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,710
no rule against it.

96
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,520
If lambda was 0, this would
say, A times the eigenvector

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,860
is 0 times the eigenvector.

98
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,900
So that would tell me
that the eigenvector

99
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,750
is in the null space.

100
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,040
It would tell me the
matrix A isn't invertible.

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,220
It's taking some vector x to 0.

102
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,550
And so everything clicks.

103
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,760
This works when it should work.

104
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,950
And if we have other fun--
any function of the matrix,

105
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,590
we could define the
exponential of a matrix.

106
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,570
18.03 would do that.

107
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,340
Let's just write it down,
as if we know what it means.

108
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,740
Does it have the
same eigenvector?

109
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,820
Well, sure.

110
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,330
Because e to the At--

111
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,900
the exponential of a matrix--

112
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,120
if I see e to the something--

113
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,610
I think of that
long, infinite series

114
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,980
that gives the exponential.

115
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,720
Those-- all the terms in
that series have powers of A.

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,250
So everything is working.

117
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,430
Every term in that series--

118
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,830
x is an eigenvector.

119
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,830
And when I put it
all together, I

120
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:47,740
learn that the eigenvalue
is e to the lambda t.

121
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,670
That's just a typical
and successful work use.

122
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,660
OK.

123
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,720
So that's eigenvectors
and eigenvalues,

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,810
and we'll find some in a minute.

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,965
Now, so I'm claiming that this--

126
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,120
that from this first thing--
which was just about certain

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,950
vectors are special--

128
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,490
now we're beginning to
see why they're useful.

129
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,720
So special is good.

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,060
Useful is even better.

131
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:37,810
So let me take any
vector, say v. And OK,

132
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,910
what do I want to do?

133
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,190
I want to use eigenvectors.

134
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,280
This v is probably
not an eigenvector.

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,330
But I'm supposing that
I've got n of them.

136
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,400
You and I are agreed
that there are

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,760
some matrices for
which there are not

138
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,290
a full set of eigenvectors.

139
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,480
That's really the main
sort of annoying point

140
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,440
in the whole subject
of linear algebra,

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,870
is some matrices don't
have enough eigenvectors.

142
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,280
But almost all do,
and let's go forward

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,730
assuming our matrix has.

144
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,820
OK.

145
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,200
So if I've got n independent
eigenvectors, that's a basis.

146
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,250
I can write any vector
v as a combination

147
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,620
of those eigenvectors.

148
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,250
Right.

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,090
And then I can find out
what A to any power.

150
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,820
So that's the point.

151
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,290
This is going to be the
simple and reason why

152
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,520
we like to have--

153
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,840
we like to know
the eigenvectors.

154
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,470
Because if I choose those
as my basis vectors,

155
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,750
v is a combination of them.

156
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,030
Now if I multiply by A, or A
squared, or A to the k power,

157
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,890
then it's linear.

158
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,950
So I can multiply each
one by A to the k.

159
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:15,300
And what do I get if I multiply
that guy by A to the kth power?

160
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,240
OK.

161
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,580
Well, I'm just going
to use-- or, here

162
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,122
I said n, but let me say k.

163
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,260
Because n-- I'm sorry.

164
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,210
I'm using n for the
size of the matrix.

165
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,870
So I better use k for
the typical case here.

166
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,460
So what do I get?

167
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,140
Just help me through
this and we're happy.

168
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,330
So what happens when I
multiply that by A to the k?

169
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,720
It's an eigenvector,
remember, so when I

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,670
multiply by A to the k, I get?

171
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,360
AUDIENCE: C1.

172
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,610
GILBERT STRANG: C1.

173
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,350
That's just a number.

174
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,840
And A to the k times
that eigenvector gives?

175
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,650
AUDIENCE: Lambda 1.

176
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,653
GILBERT STRANG: Lambda 1 to
the k times the eigenvector.

177
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,730
Right?

178
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,170
That's the whole point.

179
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,340
And linearity says keep going.

180
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:18,270
Cn, lambda n to
the kth power, Xn.

181
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,080
In other words, I can take--

182
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,820
I can apply any
power of a matrix.

183
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,250
I can apply the
exponential of a matrix.

184
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,380
I can do anything
quickly, because I've

185
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,210
got the eigenvector.

186
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,630
So really, I'm
saying the first use

187
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,900
for eigenvectors-- maybe the
principle use for which they

188
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,660
were invented-- is to be able
to solve difference equations.

189
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,560
So if I call that Vk--

190
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,790
the kth power-- then the
equation I'm solving here

191
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,530
is a one step
difference equation.

192
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,790
This is my difference equation.

193
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,140
And if I wanted to
use exponentials,

194
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,090
the equation I would be solving
would be dv, dt equal Av.

195
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:29,820
Solution to discrete steps, or
continuous time evolution comes

196
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,290
is trivial, if I know
the eigenvectors.

197
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,560
Because here is the
solution to this one.

198
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,325
And the solution to this
one is the same thing, C1, e

199
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,480
to the lambda, 1, t, x1.

200
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,180
Is that what you were expecting
for the solution here?

201
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,830
Because if I takes
the derivative,

202
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,810
it brings down a lambda.

203
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,680
If I multiply by A, it
brings down a lambda--

204
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,020
so, plus the other guys.

205
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,020
OK.

206
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,110
Not news, but important to
remember what eigenvectors

207
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,280
are for in the first place.

208
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,780
Good.

209
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,620
Yeah.

210
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,220
Let me move ahead.

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:34,270
Oh-- one matrix fact
is about something

212
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,800
called similar matrices.

213
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,680
So I have on my
matrix A. Then I have

214
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,980
the idea of what it
means to be similar to A,

215
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:56,740
so B is similar to A.
What does that mean?

216
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,410
So here's what it
means, first of all.

217
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,450
It means that B can
be found from A, by--

218
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,310
this is the key operation here--

219
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,930
multiplying by a matrix
M, and its inverse--

220
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,940
M inverse AM.

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,550
When I see two
matrices, B and A,

222
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,620
that are connected by
that kind of a change,

223
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,160
M could be any
invertible matrix.

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,410
Then I would say B was similar
to A. And that changed--

225
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,920
that appearance of
AM is pretty natural.

226
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,770
If I change variables
here by M, then I get--

227
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,850
that similar matrix
will show up.

228
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,110
So what's the key factor?

229
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,760
Do you remember the key
fact about similar matrices?

230
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,972
If B and A are
connected like that--

231
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:58,680
AUDIENCE: They have
the same eigenvalues.

232
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,380
GILBERT STRANG: They have
the same eigenvalues.

233
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,170
So this is just a useful
point to remember.

234
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:13,320
So I'll-- this is like
one fact in the discussion

235
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,780
of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

236
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:28,600
So similar matrices,
same eigenvalues.

237
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,100
Yeah.

238
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,810
So in some way in the
eigenvalue, eigenvector world,

239
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,090
they're in this--
they belong together.

240
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,503
They're connected by this
relation that just turns out

241
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:55,420
to be the right thing.

242
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,820
Actually, that is-- it gives
us a clue of how eigenvalues

243
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,950
are actually computed.

244
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:10,510
Well, they're actually
computed by typing eig of A,

245
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,080
with parentheses around
A. That's how they're--

246
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,890
in real life.

247
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,000
But what happens when
you type eig of A?

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,010
Well, you could say
the eigenvalue shows up

249
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,080
on the screen.

250
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,660
But something had
to happen in there.

251
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,250
And what happened
was that MATLAB--

252
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,540
or whoever-- took that matrix
A, started using good choices

253
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,140
of m--

254
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,610
better and better.

255
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,550
Took a bunch of steps
with different m's.

256
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,860
Because if I do another m, I
still have a similar matrix,

257
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,360
right?

258
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,300
If I take B and do a
different m2 to B--

259
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,220
so I get something
similar to B, then

260
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,230
that's also similar
to A. I've got

261
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,020
a whole family of
similar things there.

262
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:13,410
And what does MATLAB do with
all these m's, m1 and m2 and m3

263
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,580
and so on?

264
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:22,140
It brings the matrix
to a triangular matrix.

265
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,915
It gets the eigenvalues
showing up on the diagonal.

266
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,110
It's just tremendously-- it
was an inspiration when that--

267
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,990
when the good choice
of m appeared.

268
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,060
And let me just say--

269
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,120
because I'm going on
to symmetric matrices--

270
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,360
that for a symmetric matrices,
everything is sort of clean.

271
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,770
You not only go to
a triangular matrix,

272
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,380
you go toward a diagonal matrix.

273
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,380
They off-- you
choose m's that make

274
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,710
the off diagonal stuff smaller
and smaller and smaller.

275
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,230
And the eigenvalues
are not changing.

276
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,800
So there, shooting up on the
diagonal, are the eigenvalues.

277
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,329
So I guess I should
verify that fact,

278
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,329
that similar matrices
have the same eigenvalues.

279
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,300
Can we-- there can't
be much to show.

280
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,710
There can't be much in the
proof because that's all I know.

281
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,400
And I want to know its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

282
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,920
So let me say, suppose m
inverse Am has the eigenvector

283
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,125
y and the eigenvalue of lambda.

284
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,610
And I want to show--

285
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,810
do I want to show that y is an
eigenvector also, of A itself?

286
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,010
No.

287
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,140
Eigenvectors are changing.

288
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,610
Do I want to show that lambda
is an eigenvalue of A itself?

289
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,150
Yes.

290
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,560
That's my point.

291
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,656
So can we see that?

292
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,650
Ha.

293
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,250
Can I see that lambda
is an eigenvector?

294
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,440
There's not a lot to do here.

295
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,200
I mean, if I can't do it soon,
I'm never going to do it,

296
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,300
because--

297
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,845
so what am I going to do?

298
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,930
AUDIENCE: Define the
vector x equals my--

299
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,530
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah, I could.

300
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,320
Yeah.

301
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,120
X is-- m-y is going to be a
key, and I can see m-y coming.

302
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,550
Just-- when I see m
inverse over there,

303
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,345
what am I going to do
with the darn thing?

304
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:29,220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

305
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,500
GILBERT STRANG: I'm going
to put it on the other side.

306
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,020
I'm going to multiply
that equation by m.

307
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,560
So I'll have-- that will
put the m over here.

308
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,630
And I'll have A-M-y
equals lambda My, right?

309
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,520
And is that telling me
what I want to know?

310
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,790
Yes.

311
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,560
That's saying that My--

312
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,340
that you wisely suggested
to give a name x to--

313
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,025
is lambda times My.

314
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:02,285
Do you see that?

315
00:19:02,285 --> 00:19:06,650
That the eigenvalue
lambda didn't change.

316
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,970
The eigenvector did change.

317
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,480
It changed from y to My.

318
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,350
That's the x.

319
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,930
The eigenvector of x.

320
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,530
This is lambda x.

321
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,910
Yeah.

322
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,110
So that's the role of M. It
just gives you a different basis

323
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,610
for eigenvectors.

324
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,010
But it does not
change eigenvalues.

325
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,880
Right.

326
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,250
Yeah.

327
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,540
OK.

328
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,380
So those are similar matrices.

329
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah, some other
good things happen.

330
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,190
A lot of people
don't know-- in fact,

331
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,610
I wasn't very
conscious of the fact

332
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:48,500
that A times B has the same
eigenvalues as B times A. Well,

333
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,130
I should maybe write that down.

334
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:58,190
AB has the same eigenvalues--

335
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,300
the same non-zero ones--

336
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,720
you'll see.

337
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,240
I have to-- as BA.

338
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,690
This is any A and B same size.

339
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,390
I'm not talking
similar matrices here.

340
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,270
I'm talking any
two A and B. Yeah.

341
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,140
So that's a good
thing that happens.

342
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,880
Now could we see y?

343
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,240
And then I'm going to be really
pretty happy with basic fact

344
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,870
about eigenvalues.

345
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,070
So if I want to show
that two things have

346
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:45,760
the same eigenvalues,
what do you propose?

347
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,660
Show that they are similar.

348
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,440
I already said, if
they are similar.

349
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,540
So is there an m?

350
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,370
Is there an m that will
connect this matrix?

351
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,820
So is there an m that will
multiply this matrix that way?

352
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,880
So that would be similar to AB.

353
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,950
And can I produce BA then?

354
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,110
So I'll just put the
word want up here.

355
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,000
I want-- if I have
that, then I'm

356
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,140
done, because that's saying that
those two matrices, AB and BA,

357
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,160
are similar.

358
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,930
And I know that then they
have the same eigenvalues.

359
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,425
So what should m be?

360
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:49,640
M should be-- so what is M here?

361
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,870
I want that to be true.

362
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,890
Should M be B?

363
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,660
Yeah.

364
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,020
M equal B. Boy.

365
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,710
Not the most hidden fact here.

366
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,110
Take M equal B.

367
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:14,950
So then I have B times
A, times BB inverse--

368
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,130
which is the identity.

369
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,130
So I have B times A. Yes.

370
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,690
OK.

371
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,440
So AB and BA are fine.

372
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,240
Now, what do you think
about this question?

373
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,610
Are the eigenvalues-- I
now know that AB and BA

374
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,230
have the same eigenvalues.

375
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:40,730
And the reason I had to be
careful about non-zero is that

376
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,065
if I had zero
eigenvalues, then--

377
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,055
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

378
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:46,930
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

379
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,370
I can't count on those inverses.

380
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,380
Right.

381
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,570
Right.

382
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,100
So that's why I put it
in that little qualifier.

383
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,190
But now I want to
ask this question.

384
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,070
If I know the eigenvalues of A--

385
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,570
separately, by
itself, A-- and of B--

386
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,850
now I'm talking about any
two matrices, A and B.

387
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,855
If I have two matrices, A--

388
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:15,580
I have a matrix
A and a matrix B.

389
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,170
And I know their eigenvalues
and their eigenvalues.

390
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,790
What about AB?

391
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,510
A times B. Can I multiply
the eigenvalues of A times

392
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,640
the eigenvalues of B?

393
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,540
Don't do it.

394
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,080
Right.

395
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,730
Yes.

396
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:30,230
Right.

397
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,340
The eigenvalues of A
times the eigenvalues of B

398
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,620
could be damn near anything.

399
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,680
Right.

400
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,890
They're not connected to the
eigenvalues of AB specially.

401
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,800
And maybe something could
be discovered, but not much.

402
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,920
And similarly, for
A plus B. So yeah.

403
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,670
So let me just write
down this point.

404
00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,100
Eigenvalues of A plus
B are generally not

405
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:08,830
eigenvalues of A plus
eigenvalues of B.

406
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,670
Generally not.

407
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,200
Just-- there is no reason.

408
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,580
And the reason that that's--

409
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,260
I get that no answer is,
that the eigenvectors can

410
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,040
be all different.

411
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,770
If the eigenvectors
for A are totally

412
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,300
different from the
eigenvectors for B,

413
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,160
then A plus B will have probably
some other, totally different

414
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,360
eigenvectors, and there's
nothing happening there.

415
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:43,650
That's sort of thoughts
about eigenvalues in general.

416
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:50,230
And I could-- there'd be a
whole section on eigenvectors,

417
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,830
but I'm really interested
in eigenvectors

418
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,450
of symmetric matrices.

419
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:02,550
So I'm going to move
on to that topic.

420
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,410
So now, having talked
about any matrix A,

421
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,710
I'm going to specialize
to symmetric matrices,

422
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,020
see what's special
about the eigenvalues

423
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,790
there, what's special
about eigenvectors there.

424
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,720
And I think we've
already said it in class.

425
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,070
So let me-- let me
ask you to tell me

426
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,590
about it-- tell me again.

427
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,270
So I'll call that matrix
S now, as a reminder

428
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,970
always that I'm talking here
about symmetric matrices.

429
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,710
So what do I-- what are
the key facts to know?

430
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:44,360
Eigenvalues are real
numbers, if the matrix is.

431
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm thinking of real
symmetric matrices.

432
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,060
Of course, other
real matrices could

433
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,400
have imaginary eigenvalues.

434
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,620
Other real matrices-- so just--

435
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,860
let's just think for a moment.

436
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah.

437
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,620
Maybe I'll just put it here.

438
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:09,760
Can I back up, before I keep
going with symmetric matrices?

439
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,610
So you take a matrix like that.

440
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,850
Q, yeah.

441
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,500
That would be a Q. But it's
not specially a Q. Maybe

442
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,320
the most remarkable
thing about that matrix

443
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,080
is that it's anti-symmetric.

444
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,630
So I'll call it A. Right.

445
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,942
If I transpose that
matrix, what do I get?

446
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,900
AUDIENCE: The negative.

447
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,108
GILBERT STRANG: The negative.

448
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:42,400
So that's like anti-symmetric.

449
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,430
And I claim that an
anti-symmetric matrix

450
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,830
has imaginary eigenvalues.

451
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,010
So that's a 90 degree rotation.

452
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,040
And you might say, what
could be simpler than that?

453
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,050
A 90 degree rotation--
that's not a weird matrix.

454
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,740
But from the point of
view of eigenvectors,

455
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,620
something a little odd
has to happen, right?

456
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,010
Because if I have a
90 degree rotation--

457
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,720
if I take a vector x--

458
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,250
any vector x-- could it
possibly be an eigenvector?

459
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,910
Well, apply A to it.

460
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,510
You'd be off in
this direction, Ax.

461
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:30,390
And there is no way that
Ax can be a multiple of x.

462
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,950
So there's no real eigenvector
for that anti-symmetric matrix,

463
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,710
or any anti-symmetric matrix.

464
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,480
So you see that when we
say that the eigenvalues

465
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,090
of a symmetric matrix
are real, we're

466
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,180
saying that this
couldn't happen--

467
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,160
that this couldn't happen
if A were symmetric.

468
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,010
And here, it's the very
opposite, it's anti-symmetric.

469
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,820
Well, while that's on the board,
you might say, wait a minute.

470
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,160
How could that have any
eigenvector whatsoever?

471
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,300
So what is an eigenvector
of that matrix A?

472
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,080
How do you find the
eigenvectors of A?

473
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,850
When they're 2 by 2, that's a
calculation we know how to do.

474
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,950
You remember the steps there?

475
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,690
I'm looking for
Ax equal lambda x.

476
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,020
So right now I'm looking
for both lambda and x.

477
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,050
I've got 2.

478
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,900
It's not linear, but I'm going
to bring this over to this side

479
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,405
and write it as A minus
lambda I, x equals 0.

480
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,680
And then I'm going
to look at that

481
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,850
and say, wow, A minus lambda
I must be not invertible,

482
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,690
b because it's got this
x in its null space.

483
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,680
So the determinant of
this matrix must be 0.

484
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:06,300
I couldn't have a null space
unless the determinant is 0.

485
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,590
And then when I look at A
minus lambda I, for this A,

486
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:20,350
I've got minus
lambdas, minus A--

487
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,820
oh, A is just the 1.

488
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,700
And that's minus 1.

489
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,250
I'm going to take
the determinant.

490
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,100
And what am I going to
get for the determinant?

491
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,732
Lambda squared--

492
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:31,722
AUDIENCE: Plus 1.

493
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:32,680
GILBERT STRANG: Plus 1.

494
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,156
And I set that to 0.

495
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,020
So I'm just following
all the rules,

496
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,322
but it's showing me
that the lambda--

497
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:55,150
the two lambdas-- there
are two lambdas here--

498
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,300
but they're not real, because
that equation, the roots

499
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,770
are i and minus i.

500
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,250
So those are the eigenvalues.

501
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,710
And they have the nice--

502
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,180
they have all the--

503
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,530
well, they are the eigenvalues.

504
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,520
No doubt about it.

505
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,360
With 2 by 2 there are two quick
checks that tell you, yeah,

506
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,790
you did a calculation right.

507
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:31,970
If I add up the two
eigenvalues in this--

508
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,550
if I add up the two
eigenvalues for any matrix,

509
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,310
and I'm going to do
it for this one--

510
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,420
I get what answer?

511
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,500
AUDIENCE: The trace?

512
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,430
GILBERT STRANG: I get the
same answer from the adding--

513
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,410
add the lambdas gives
me the same answer

514
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:56,690
as add the diagonal
of the matrix--

515
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,130
which I'm calling A. So if I
add the diagonal I get 0 and 0.

516
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,910
So it's 0 plus 0.

517
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,165
And this number adding the
diagonal is called the trace.

518
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:19,130
And we'll see it again
because it's so simple.

519
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,910
Just adding the diagonal
entries gives you

520
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,370
a key bit of information.

521
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,230
When you add down
the diagonal it

522
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,960
tells you the sum of
the eigenvalue-- some

523
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,670
of the lambdas.

524
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,970
Doesn't tell you each
lambda separately,

525
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,890
but it tells you the sum.

526
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,380
So it tells you one
fact by doing one thing.

527
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,210
Yeah.

528
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,170
That's pretty handy.

529
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,010
Gives you a quick
check if you've--

530
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,840
when you compute
this determinant

531
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,414
and solve for lambda--

532
00:31:54,414 --> 00:32:03,440
the thing you-- this is a way
to compute eigenvalues by hand.

533
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,120
You could make a
mistake, because it's

534
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,770
a quadratic formula
for 2 by 2, but you can

535
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,270
check by adding the two roots.

536
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,640
Do you get the same
as the trace 0 plus 0?

537
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,370
Well, there's one other check,
equally quick, for 2 by 2,

538
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,690
so 2 by 2s--

539
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,940
you really get them right.

540
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,070
What's the other check to--

541
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,860
we add the eigenvalues,
we get the trace.

542
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

543
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,010
GILBERT STRANG: We
multiply the eigenvalues.

544
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:45,640
So we take-- so now
multiply the lambdas.

545
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,600
So then I get i times minus i.

546
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,550
And that should equal--
let's-- don't look yet.

547
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,060
What should it equal if I
multiply the eigenvalues

548
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,870
I should get the?

549
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,810
AUDIENCE: Determinant.

550
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,700
GILBERT STRANG:
Determinant, right.

551
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:12,680
Of A. So that's
two handy checks.

552
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,900
Add the eigenvalues--
for any size--

553
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,230
3 by 3, 4 by 4-- but
it's only two checks.

554
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,080
So for 2 by 2, it's
kind of, you've got it.

555
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,300
3 by 3, 4 by 4--
you could still have

556
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,630
made an error and the two checks
could potentially still work.

557
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,920
Let's just check it out here.

558
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,570
What's i times minus i?

559
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,030
AUDIENCE: 1.

560
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,230
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

561
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,290
Because it's minus i
squared, and that's plus 1.

562
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,950
And the determinant of
that matrix is 0 minus--

563
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,450
is 1.

564
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,170
Yeah.

565
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:47,820
OK.

566
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,150
So we got 1.

567
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,650
Good.

568
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,340
Those are really the key
fact about eigenvalues.

569
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,550
But of course they're
not-- it's not

570
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,360
as simple as solving Ax
equal B to find them,

571
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:13,980
but if you follow through on
this idea of similar matrices,

572
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,510
and sort of chop down the
off diagonal part, then

573
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,900
sure enough, the
eigenvalue's gotta show up.

574
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,790
OK.

575
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,449
Symmetric.

576
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,905
Symmetric matrices.

577
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,830
So now we're going
to have symmetric,

578
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,639
and then we'll have the special,
even better than symmetric,

579
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,690
is symmetric positive definite.

580
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,190
OK.

581
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:56,330
Symmetric-- you told me the main
facts are the eigenvalues real,

582
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:02,040
the eigenvectors orthogonal.

583
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,280
And I guess, actually--

584
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,420
yeah.

585
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,380
So I want to put those into
math symbols instead of words.

586
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,500
So yeah.

587
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,270
I guess-- shall I just jump in?

588
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:36,830
And the other thing hidden
there-- but very important is--

589
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,790
there's a full set
of eigenvectors,

590
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,400
even if some eigenvalues
happen to be repeated,

591
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,650
like the identity matrix.

592
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,940
It's still got plenty
of eigenvectors.

593
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,150
So that's a added point
that I've not made there.

594
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,720
And I could prove
those two statements,

595
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,998
but why don't I ask you to
accept them and go onward?

596
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,240
What are we going
to do with them?

597
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,740
OK.

598
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,430
Can you just-- let's
have an example.

599
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,690
Let me put an example here.

600
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,910
Suppose S-- now
I'm calling it S--

601
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,610
is 0s, 1 and 1.

602
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,960
So that's symmetric.

603
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,080
What are its eigenvalues?

604
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,140
What are the eigenvalues of
that symmetric matrix, S?

605
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,370
AUDIENCE: Plus and minus 1.

606
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,878
GILBERT STRANG:
Plus and minus 1.

607
00:36:40,878 --> 00:36:43,660
Well, if you propose
two eigenvalues,

608
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,730
I'll write them
down, 1 and minus 1.

609
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,727
And then what will
I do to check them?

610
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:51,060
AUDIENCE: Trace and determinant.

611
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,810
GILBERT STRANG: Trace
and determinant.

612
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:54,330
OK.

613
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,600
So are they-- is it true
that the eigenvalues

614
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,600
are 1 and minus 1?

615
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,370
OK.

616
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,020
How do I check the trace?

617
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,640
What is the trace
of that matrix?

618
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,350
0.

619
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,630
And what's the sum
of the eigenvalues--

620
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,450
0.

621
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,570
Good.

622
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,710
What about determinant?

623
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,380
What's the determinant of S?

624
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,290
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

625
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,290
GILBERT STRANG: Minus 1.

626
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,290
The product of the
eigenvalues-- minus 1.

627
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,590
So we've got it.

628
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,480
OK.

629
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,820
What are the eigenvectors?

630
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,070
What vector can you
multiply by and it

631
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:32,010
doesn't change direction-- in
fact, doesn't change at all?

632
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,735
I'm looking for the eigenvector
that's a steady state?

633
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:37,180
AUDIENCE: 0, 1?

634
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,115
GILBERT STRANG: 0, 1?

635
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:41,090
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

636
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,780
GILBERT STRANG: I
think it's 1, 1.

637
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,280
Yeah.

638
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,380
So here is the lambdas.

639
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,420
And then the eigenvectors are--

640
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,800
I think 1, 1.

641
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,760
Is that right?

642
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,260
Yeah.

643
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,190
Sure.

644
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,010
S is just a permutation here.

645
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,230
It's just exchanging
the two entries.

646
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,770
So 1 and 1 won't change.

647
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,378
And what's the
other eigenvector?

648
00:38:04,378 --> 00:38:05,940
AUDIENCE: Minus 1?

649
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,190
GILBERT STRANG: 1 and minus 1.

650
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,090
And then, I'm thinking--
remembering about this similar

651
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,140
stuff--

652
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:27,610
I'm thinking that S is
similar to a matrix that

653
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,710
just shows the eigenvalues.

654
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,690
So S is similar to--

655
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,410
I'm going to put in an M--

656
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,960
well, I'm going to
connect S-- that matrix--

657
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,160
with the eigenvalue matrix,
which has the eigenvalues.

658
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,430
So here is my--

659
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,770
everybody calls that
matrix capital lambda,

660
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,550
because everybody calls the
eigenvalues little lambda.

661
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,330
So the matrix that has them
is called capital lambda.

662
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,610
And I-- my claim is that
these guys are similar--

663
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,650
that this matrix, S, that
you're seeing up there--

664
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,890
I believe there
is an M I believe

665
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,650
there is an M. So that S--

666
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,510
what did I put in here?

667
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,370
So I'm following this pattern.

668
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:24,280
I believe that there would
be an M and an M inverse,

669
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,590
so that this would mean that.

670
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,870
And that's nice.

671
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,530
First of all, it would
confirm that the eigenvalues

672
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:38,210
stay the same, which
was certain to happen.

673
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,720
And then it would also mean that
I had got a diagonal matrix.

674
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
And of course, that's
a natural goal--

675
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,945
to get a diagonal matrix.

676
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,210
So we might hope that
the M that gets us there

677
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,510
is like an important matrix.

678
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,520
So do you see what
I'm doing here?

679
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,350
It comes under the heading
of diagonalizing a matrix.

680
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:08,840
I start with a matrix, S.
I find it's eigenvalues.

681
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,420
They go on into lambda.

682
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:19,980
And I believe I can find an M,
so that I see they're similar.

683
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,660
They have the same eigenvalues,
1 and minus 1, both sides.

684
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,650
So only remaining
question is, what's M?

685
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,262
What's the matrix
that diagonalizes S?

686
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:35,745
The-- what have we
got left to use?

687
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:36,870
AUDIENCE: The eigenvectors.

688
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:39,140
GILBERT STRANG:
The eigenvectors.

689
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,010
The matrix that-- so, can
I put the M over there?

690
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,460
Yeah.

691
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,590
I'll put-- that M
inverse is going

692
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,180
to go over to the other side.

693
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:52,680
Oh.

694
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,800
It goes here, doesn't it?

695
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,240
I was worried there.

696
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,630
It didn't look good, but yeah.

697
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,192
So this is all going
to be right, if--

698
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,460
this is what I'd like to have--

699
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,980
SM equal M lambda.

700
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,810
SM equal M lambda.

701
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,120
That's diagonalizing a matrix.

702
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,390
That's finding the M
using the eigenvectors.

703
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,850
That produces a
similar matrix lambda,

704
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,270
which has the eigenvalues.

705
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:35,810
That's the great fact
about diagonalizing.

706
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,160
That's how you use--
that's another way to say,

707
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,610
this is how the
eigenvectors pay off.

708
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,880
You put them into M. You
take the similar matrix

709
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,830
and it's nice and diagonal.

710
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,970
And do you see that
this will happen?

711
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,410
S times-- so M has
the first eigenvector

712
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,870
and the second eigenvector.

713
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:59,690
And I believe that first
eigenvector times the second--

714
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,660
and the second eigenvector--
that's M again, on this side.

715
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,375
Let me just write
in 1, 0, 0, minus 1.

716
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,620
I believe is has got to
be confirming that we've

717
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,510
done the thing right--

718
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,030
confirming that the
eigenvectors work here.

719
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,410
Please make sense out
of that last line.

720
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,180
When you see that
last line, what do I

721
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,460
mean to make sense out of it?

722
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,860
I want to see that that's true.

723
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,180
How do I see that--

724
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,770
how do I do this--

725
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,050
so what's the left side
and what's the right side?

726
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,910
So what-- if I
multiply S by a couple

727
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:54,013
of columns, what's the answer?

728
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,615
AUDIENCE: Sx1 and Sx2.

729
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,920
GILBERT STRANG: Sx1 and Sx2.

730
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,590
That's the beauty of
matrix multiplication.

731
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,090
If I multiply a matrix
by another matrix,

732
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,400
I can do it a column at a time.

733
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,690
There are four great ways
to multiply matrices,

734
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,900
so this is another one--

735
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,010
a column at a time.

736
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:16,810
So this left hand
side is Sx1, Sx2.

737
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,810
I just do each column.

738
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,030
And what about the
right hand side?

739
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,404
I can do that multiplication.

740
00:43:25,404 --> 00:43:26,730
AUDIENCE: X1 minus x2.

741
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,860
GILBERT STRANG: X1 minus
x2 did somebody say?

742
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,840
Death.

743
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,340
No.

744
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,520
I don't want-- Oh, x1--

745
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,020
sorry.

746
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,360
You said it right.

747
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,330
OK.

748
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,120
When you said x1 minus
x2, I was subtracting.

749
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,660
But you meant that that's--
the first column is x1,

750
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,820
and the second
column is minus x2.

751
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,758
Correct.

752
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:46,734
Sorry about that.

753
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,170
And did we come out right?

754
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,310
Yes.

755
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,140
Of course, now I compare.

756
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,990
Sx1 is lambda one x1.

757
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,860
Sx2 is lambda two x2.

758
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,520
And I'm golden.

759
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,310
So what was the
point of this board?

760
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,640
What did we learn?

761
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,750
We learned-- well, we kind of
expected that the original S

762
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:26,690
would be similar to the lambdas,
because the eigenvalues match.

763
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,790
S has eigenvalues lambda.

764
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,860
And this diagonal
matrix certainly

765
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,260
has eigenvalues 1n minus 1.

766
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,210
A diagonal matrix--
the eigenvalues

767
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,050
are right in front of you.

768
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,280
So they're similar.

769
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,560
S is similar to the lambda.

770
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,310
And there should be an M. And
then somebody suggested, maybe

771
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,260
the M is the eigenvectors.

772
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,550
And that's the right answer.

773
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:53,070
So finally, let me write
that conclusion here--

774
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,650
which isn't just for
symmetric matrices.

775
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:04,710
So maybe I should
put it for matrix A.

776
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:12,480
So if it has lambdas
and eigenvectors,

777
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:22,300
and the claim is that A
times the eigenvector matrix

778
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:28,793
is the eigenvector matrix
times the eigenvalues.

779
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,750
And I would shorten that
to Ax equals x lambda.

780
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:44,200
And I could rewrite
that, and then I'll

781
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,270
slow down, as A equal
x lambda x inverse.

782
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,040
Really, this is
bringing it all together

783
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,740
in a simple, small formula.

784
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,360
It's telling us that A
is similar to lambda.

785
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,360
It's telling us the matrix
M, that does the job--

786
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,390
it's a matrix of eigenvectors.

787
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:21,580
And so it's like a shorthand
way to write the main fact

788
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,390
about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

789
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,470
What about A squared?

790
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,840
Can I go back to
the very first--

791
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,510
I see time is close
to the end here.

792
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,850
What about A squared?

793
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:36,810
What are the eigenvectors
of A squared?

794
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,410
What are the eigenvalues
of A squared?

795
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,700
That's like the whole
point of eigenvalues.

796
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,160
Well, or I could just
square that stupid thing.

797
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,140
X lambda, x inverse,
x lambda, x inverse.

798
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,600
And what have I got?

799
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,730
X inverse, x in the middle is--

800
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,570
AUDIENCE: Identity.

801
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:58,220
GILBERT STRANG: Identity.

802
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,010
So I have x, lambda
squared, x inverse.

803
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,910
And to me and to you that
says, the eigenvalues

804
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,810
have been squared.

805
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,840
The eigenvectors didn't change.

806
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,740
Yeah.

807
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,300
OK.

808
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,250
And now finally,
last breath is, what

809
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,280
if the matrix is symmetric?

810
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,870
Then we have different letters.

811
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:23,850
That's the only-- that's
the significant change.

812
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:30,310
The eigenvector matrix is
now an orthogonal matrix.

813
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,850
I'm coming back to the key
fact of what makes symmetric--

814
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,930
how do I read--

815
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:39,350
how do I see symmetric
helping me in the eigenvector

816
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,180
and eigenvalue world?

817
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,960
Well, it tells me that the
eigenvectors are orthogonal.

818
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,140
So the x is Q. The
eigenvalues are real.

819
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,880
And the eigenvectors
is x inverse.

820
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,910
But now I'm going to make those
eigenvectors unit vectors.

821
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,230
I'm going to normalize it.

822
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,330
So I'm really allowing--

823
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:08,020
I have an orthogonal matrix
Q. So I have a different way

824
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,780
to write this, and this
is the end of the--

825
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,370
today's class.

826
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:15,430
Q lambda.

827
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,355
And what can you tell
me about Q inverse?

828
00:48:18,355 --> 00:48:19,480
AUDIENCE: It's Q transpose.

829
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,630
GILBERT STRANG:
It's Q transpose.

830
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,130
Thanks.

831
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,240
So that was the last lecture.

832
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,490
So now the orthogonal
lecture is coming up

833
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:31,600
at the last second of the
symmetric matrices lecture.

834
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:35,380
And this has the name
spectral theorem,

835
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,730
which I'll just put there.

836
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,640
And the whole point
is that it tells you

837
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,430
what every symmetric
matrix looks like--

838
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,965
orthogonal eigenvectors,
real eigenvalues.
