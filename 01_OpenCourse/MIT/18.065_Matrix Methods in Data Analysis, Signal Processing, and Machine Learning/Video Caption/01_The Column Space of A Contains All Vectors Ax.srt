GILBERT STRANG: Shall we start?

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,780
Let me just say, this is
a great adventure for me

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,900
to be here all on my own,
teaching a course that

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,400
involves learning from data.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,450
So it's an exciting subject,
and a lot of linear algebra

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,290
goes into it.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,350
So it's a second course
on linear algebra.

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,900
Can I just-- so there is a
Stellar site established,

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,770
and that will be the
basic thing that we use.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,470
This is a public site--

18
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:05,310
math.mit.edu/learningfromdata.

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:11,630
So a book is coming pretty
quickly as we speak,

20
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:20,410
or after we speak, and that
site has the table of contents

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,140
of the book, which would
give you an idea of what

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,580
could be in the course.

23
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,480
And I printed out a copy for
everybody just of that one

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,980
page.

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,340
This is probably the final--

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,820
first and last handout--

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,780
maybe-- with a
table of contents,

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,930
which you'll see there.

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,050
And also, you'll see there
the first two sections

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,820
of the book, which is
what I'll talk about today

31
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,830
and a little bit into Friday.

32
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,400
So that's linear algebra, of
course, because the course

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,820
begins with linear algebra--

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,640
actually, things that you
would know from 18.06,

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,310
but this is a way to say this
is really important stuff.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,820
So that's what I'll do today.

37
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,410
I'd like to start on the
linear algebra today.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,205
Here's a great fact
about the course.

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,830
So we taught it last
year, several of us

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,840
together, and we knew there
wouldn't be a final exam,

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,580
but we imagined there might
be quizzes along the way.

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,610
But then we couldn't think of
anything to put on the quizzes.

43
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,590
So we canceled those.

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,930
But you do we learn
a lot, nevertheless.

45
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,410
And so I guess we base the
grades on the homeworks.

46
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,140
So the homeworks will be
partly linear algebra questions

47
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,990
and partly online, like
recognizing handwriting,

48
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,880
stitching images together,
many other things.

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,330
And I'll talk about
those as we go.

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,980
Good.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,710
So that's the general picture.

52
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,310
And I'll say more
about it today.

53
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,140
And I could answer
any question about it.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,740
So we're getting videotaped.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,990
So if anybody's bashful,
sit in the far back.

56
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,860
But it'll be fun.

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,430
You may know the
videos for 18.06.

58
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,270
So this is the
next step, 18.065.

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,170
It's pretty exciting for me.

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,210
So any question, or
shall I do a little math?

61
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,990
Why not?

62
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:53,620
And then I'll say a little
more about the course,

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,610
just so you have an
idea of what's ahead.

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,910
And it looks like this room is
exactly the right size to me,

65
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,140
so I'm pleased.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,210
So what's the deal
in linear algebra?

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,970
Forgive me if I
start with what I

68
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,730
do the very first day
in 18.06, which is

69
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,770
multiply a matrix by a vector.

70
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,290
And then I'll graduate
to multiplying a matrix

71
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,410
by a matrix.

72
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,640
And you will say,
I know that stuff.

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,500
But do you know
it the right way?

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,660
Do you think of the
multiplication the right way?

75
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,320
So let me tell you what I
believe to be the right way.

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:56,190
So let me take a matrix, say,
2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and 3, 4, 12.

77
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:02,470
And I'll always call matrices A.

78
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,750
So first step is just A
times x, A times a vector.

79
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,640
So I multiply A by,
let's say, x1, x2, x3.

80
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,310
And how do I look
at that answer?

81
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,020
So the choices-- think
of the rows of the matrix

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,440
or think of the columns.

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,110
And if you think
of the rows, which

84
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,690
is the standard way to multiply,
you would take the dot product.

85
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:43,280
So the first way is dot
products of row dotted with x.

86
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,200
2x1 plus x2 plus 3x3.

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,330
It gives you the answer
a component at a time.

88
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,630
That's the low level way.

89
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,140
The good way to see
it is vector-wise.

90
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:08,690
See this as x1 multiplies
that first column, x2 times

91
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,360
the second column,
1, 1, 7, and x3 times

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,530
the third column, 3, 4, 12.

93
00:06:21,994 --> 00:06:24,480
Good.

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,750
So it's a combination
of vectors,

95
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,740
and of course, it
produces a vector.

96
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,800
And here, we have a 3 by
3 matrix on our vectors

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,960
are in R3.

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,100
And most vectors will be in
R3 or Rn for this course.

99
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,400
So that's the right answer.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,430
And of course, the
first component

101
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,950
is 2x1 and 1x2 and 3x3.

102
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,510
The same 2, 1, 3-- the same dot
product, it comes out right.

103
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,920
But you see it all at
once instead of piecemeal.

104
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,860
Part of the course--

105
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,740
I guess part of what
I hope to get across

106
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,590
is thinking of a matrix
as a whole thing,

107
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,270
not just a bunch of nine
or m times n numbers.

108
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,280
But thinking of it as a thing.

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,020
A matrix multiplies a vector
to give another vector.

110
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:32,040
So when I say Ax, you
immediately think that--

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,580
you immediately think, OK,
Ax has a clear meaning,

112
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,310
it's a combination
of the columns of A.

113
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,530
So now let me take
that next step.

114
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,540
And the next step is think
about all combinations

115
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,645
of the columns of A.
We take the matrix A,

116
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:57,670
and we take all x's and we
imagine all the outputs.

117
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,330
And what I want to ask you
is, what does that look like?

118
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,070
If I just take 1 vector
x, I get a vector output.

119
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,410
It takes a vector to a vector.

120
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,990
But now I take all x's--

121
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,060
all of vectors x in 3D and
I get all these answers,

122
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,435
and I think of
them all together.

123
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,390
So I've got a bunch of vectors--

124
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,940
infinitely many
vectors, actually.

125
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,290
And the question is, if I plot
those infinitely many vectors,

126
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,179
what do I have?

127
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,480
And the beauty of linear algebra
is that questions like this--

128
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,429
you can answer them and
you intuitively see it.

129
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,680
You certainly see it in 3D
and you have the right idea

130
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,620
in 10 dimensions, even.

131
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,290
Most of us don't see
too well in 10d--

132
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,090
in R10.

133
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,740
But here we got three.

134
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,850
So do you see what I'm saying?

135
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,950
I'm taking all x's.

136
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:09,800
So all Ax gives us a
big bunch of vectors.

137
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,400
And that collection
of vectors is

138
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,460
called the column space of A.
It's a space, in other words.

139
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,412
That's the key word there,
the column space of A.

140
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:29,900
And I'll just write it as C of
A when I need letters for it.

141
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,540
So I'm going to ask you,
what does this column space

142
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,190
look like?

143
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,650
And that depends on the matrix.

144
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,230
Sometimes that column space
would be the whole of R3.

145
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,070
Sometimes it's a smaller
set in R3, a space.

146
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,700
Do you know what
it is in this case?

147
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,110
Do I get all of 3D
out of these guys

148
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,380
by choosing all
x1 and x2 and x3?

149
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,090
It seems like if it
was a random matrix,

150
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,010
the answer would
be, surely, yes.

151
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,720
If a random three
by three matrix is--

152
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,390
it's column space is going
to be all of our three,

153
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,050
its columns are going
to be independent,

154
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,990
its rows are going
to be independent,

155
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,890
it's going to be invertible,
it's going to be great.

156
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,420
But is this matrix--

157
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,930
what's up with that matrix?

158
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,210
No, it's not.

159
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,560
So what do I get
instead of all of R3?

160
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,390
I get a plane, yeah.

161
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,910
If you get that insight.

162
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,280
So by taking x's--

163
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,170
everybody's with
me-- all x's here.

164
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,460
So that means that
it fills in whatever.

165
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,250
And, well, because
it's linear algebra,

166
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:52,960
it's going to be likely all of
R3 or a plane, or even a line.

167
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,390
Let me just bat over
here for a moment.

168
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:03,650
Give me a matrix whose column
space would only be a line.

169
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,780
All 1s?

170
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,300
OK.

171
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,500
Wow, that's a-- let me
liven it up a little.

172
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,180
3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8.

173
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,410
So I think that the
combinations of those columns

174
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,870
are all on the same line.

175
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,800
That says that the column
space is just a line.

176
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,220
And I would say then
that the matrix--

177
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,520
so column space of
this A is a line.

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,930
Another way I could say this
is that the rank of the matrix

179
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,450
is 1.

180
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,470
The rank is sort of the
dimension of the column space.

181
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,180
Well, not sort,
that's what it is.

182
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,430
The rank is the
dimension of the column--

183
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,530
everybody sees that
you get a line?

184
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,410
Because any combination
x1 of that plus x2

185
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,150
of that plus x3 of that is
going to go along that line.

186
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,050
Here's the first column,
here's the second column.

187
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,580
They're all on a line.

188
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,070
So I'll never get off that line.

189
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,470
If I allow all x's,
I'll get the whole line.

190
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,070
Now here, you said not a line.

191
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,410
What was the column
space for this guy?

192
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,730
Plane.

193
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,130
Now, why isn't it all of R3?

194
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,860
What do you see
that's special there--

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,050
because it is special--

196
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,350
that's making the column
space special, a plane instead

197
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,820
of the whole thing?

198
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,430
Yeah, what's up with
these three columns?

199
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,820
AUDIENCE: The third
column is the sum of it.

200
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:46,160
GILBERT STRANG: The third
column is the sum of these two.

201
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,660
So the first column
is fine, 2, 3, 5.

202
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,210
Second column is in a
different direction.

203
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,190
And when I take combinations
of the first two columns,

204
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,200
what will I get?

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,900
Sorry to keep asking you
questions, but that's--

206
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,960
anyway, that's what I always do.

207
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,470
So the combinations of those
first two columns are--?

208
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,420
AUDIENCE: A plane.

209
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,170
GILBERT STRANG: A
plane because they're

210
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,790
in different-- everybody
sees that picture.

211
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,960
We've got column one going
that way and column two

212
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,630
going that way.

213
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,500
And then if I take any
multiple of column one,

214
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,890
I've got a whole line, any
multiple of column two.

215
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,840
And then when I put
the two together,

216
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,940
it fills in the plane.

217
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,440
Yeah.

218
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,910
Your intuition
says that's right.

219
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,640
So this is a matrix of rank.

220
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,350
What's the rank of this matrix?

221
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,240
AUDIENCE: Two.

222
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,030
GILBERT STRANG: Two.

223
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,550
Because it's got two
independent columns,

224
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,800
but the third
column is dependent.

225
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,510
The third column is a
combination of the others.

226
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,620
So matrices like this are
really the building blocks

227
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,290
of linear algebra, they're
the building blocks

228
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,930
of data science.

229
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,100
They're rank one matrices.

230
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,390
And let me show you a special
way to write those rank one

231
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,010
matrices.

232
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,100
I think of this matrix as
the column vector 1, 1,

233
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,720
1 times the row vector 1, 3, 8.

234
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,050
So it's a column times a row.

235
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,640
That's a rank one matrix.

236
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,850
Do you see-- that's a
true multiplication there.

237
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,960
It looks a little weird, but
it's a 3 by 1 matrix times a 1

238
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,580
by 3 matrix.

239
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,350
These numbers have
to be the same,

240
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,110
and then the output is 3 by 3.

241
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,020
And it's that.

242
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,780
And do you see that it factors?

243
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,820
So I'm going to move
on to that idea.

244
00:14:51,820 --> 00:15:01,600
The next idea coming up
will be that we can see--

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,570
well, that's coming, that
we're going to see matrices

246
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,950
with two factors.

247
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,630
Let me move to that, but back
for this original matrix.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,380
So what's with this?

249
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,860
The column space is a plane.

250
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,110
Think about now the key
idea of independent columns.

251
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,777
How many independent
columns have I got here?

252
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:34,360
AUDIENCE: Two.

253
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,740
GILBERT STRANG: Two, correct.

254
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,970
Two.

255
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,290
The third column, if I want to
especially pick on that one--

256
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,850
I'll often go left to right.

257
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,230
So I'll say the first guy
is good, second guy is good,

258
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,080
the third guy is not
independent of the others.

259
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,290
So I just have two
independent columns.

260
00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:01,080
And those two columns would be
a basis for the column space.

261
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,280
So that's the critical
idea of linear algebra.

262
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,160
That's what you compute
when you find a basis,

263
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,910
and everything in
the column space

264
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,780
is a combination of these,
including that is also--

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,430
that's already a
combination of those.

266
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,920
But everything else
in the column space

267
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,010
is a combination of those two.

268
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,600
So they're a basis for it.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,060
So you have the
idea of A times x.

270
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,090
You have the idea of
column space of A,

271
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,470
which allows all x's.

272
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:43,990
Then now, we're moving into the
idea of independent columns,

273
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,230
and the number of independent
columns is the rank.

274
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,640
So the rank-- shall I
write that somewhere?

275
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,630
Maybe here.

276
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,765
The rank is the number
of independent columns.

277
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,880
And right now, what do I
mean by independent columns?

278
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,730
Well, let's just see what
that means by using it.

279
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,720
Are we good?

280
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,520
I know I'm reviewing here.

281
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,690
But allow me for this first
class and part of next time

282
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,589
also to review.

283
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,970
But you'll see something new.

284
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,220
In fact, why don't we see
something new right away.

285
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,520
Let me follow up on the
idea of independence

286
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,900
in a systematic way.

287
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:41,370
So here's my matrix A.
Can I write that again?

288
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:50,430
2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 7, and this
guy was the sum of those.

289
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,970
So that's my matrix A.

290
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,520
So let's start from scratch
and find a basis for the column

291
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,670
space in the most natural way.

292
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,760
So I'm going to take a basis--

293
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,500
what's a basis?

294
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,270
A basis is independent columns.

295
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,840
So all three together
would not be a basis.

296
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,170
But they have to be
not just independent,

297
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,290
but they have to fill the
space-- their combinations have

298
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,760
to fill the space.

299
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,580
So 2, 3, 5--

300
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,860
let's say I want
to create a basis.

301
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,080
I'll call the matrix C, a
basis for the column space.

302
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,460
So here's a natural
way to do it.

303
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,620
I look at the first column.

304
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,370
It's not 0s.

305
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,925
If it was all 0s, I wouldn't
want that in a basis.

306
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,760
But it's not.

307
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,530
So I put it in.

308
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,930
So that's the first
vector in my basis.

309
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,130
Then I go on to
the second column.

310
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,780
If that column was 4,
6, 10, what would I do?

311
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,040
If that second
column was 4, 6, 10,

312
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,084
would I put it in the basis?

313
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,060
No.

314
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,100
But 1, 1, 7, is OK, right?

315
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,390
1, 1, 7 is in a
different direction.

316
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,380
It's not a combination of
what we've already got.

317
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,980
So I say, OK, that
adds something new.

318
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,500
Put it in.

319
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,590
Then I move on to
the third column.

320
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,730
Do I put that into a basis?

321
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,110
You know the answer by now.

322
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,130
No.

323
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,140
Because I'm looking to see, is
it a combination of these guys?

324
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,640
And it is.

325
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,650
It's one of that
plus one of that.

326
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,120
So it's not independent.

327
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,730
So I've finished now.

328
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,974
I've got a matrix C, which
was taken directly from A,

329
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:55,100
and I kept only
independent columns

330
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,360
and I worked from left to right.

331
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,230
And I can see that right away
now that the rank is two--

332
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,350
the column rank, I should
say-- the column rank.

333
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,490
The number of independent
columns is two.

334
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,220
Good?

335
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,830
Now comes the key step.

336
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:26,790
I'm going to produce
a third matrix, R,

337
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:32,090
which is going to tell me
how to get these columns

338
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,160
from these columns.

339
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,290
And its shape is going to be--

340
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,140
well, its shape-- I
don't have any choice.

341
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,960
This is three by two, so Rx
would be two by something.

342
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,840
So I'm like so.

343
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,360
I guess it has to be two by
three because I want to come

344
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,230
out this way, two by three.

345
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,670
What am I going to do here?

346
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm just going to
put it in the numbers

347
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,555
R that make this correct.

348
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,600
So this is a first
matrix factorization.

349
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,510
It's not-- well, it is
a famous one, actually.

350
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,930
When we see it, we'll
recognize what it is.

351
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,850
It's famous in teaching
linear algebra,

352
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,210
but now, actually, C times
R, columns times rows

353
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,120
has become very, very
important in large scale

354
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,490
numerical linear algebra.

355
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:38,610
So let's figure out
what goes into R.

356
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,560
What am I thinking here?

357
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,940
I'm putting in R. So
every one of these columns

358
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,350
is a combination of these.

359
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,300
That's the whole point.

360
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,080
And I'm just going to put in
the numbers that you need.

361
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,960
So what goes in the
first column of R?

362
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,300
What goes in the
first column of R?

363
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,460
So I want to look,
what combination

364
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,450
of that column and that
column gives me this one?

365
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:03,950
Yeah?

366
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,795
AUDIENCE: 1, 0.

367
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:05,670
GILBERT STRANG: 1, 0.

368
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,750
Because you remember how we
multiply a matrix by a vector?

369
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,860
When I multiply that
matrix by that vector,

370
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,410
I take one of this
plus zero of that.

371
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,580
I see it vector-wise, and
of course I get it right.

372
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,460
And what about the
second column of R?

373
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,980
So the second column
should be the combination

374
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,820
that produces the second
column of A correctly.

375
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,720
What will that be?

376
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,415
AUDIENCE: 0, 1.

377
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:37,290
GILBERT STRANG: 0, 1.

378
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,570
Thanks.

379
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,736
And finally the third column?

380
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,650
AUDIENCE: 1, 1.

381
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,040
GILBERT STRANG: 1, 1.

382
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,570
Yes, right.

383
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,690
Because one of this plus one of
this produces the third column.

384
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,000
So all I did was put in the
right numbers there, really.

385
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,070
And this is correct now.

386
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,380
A is C times R. And so this is--

387
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,590
what I've done here
is the first two pages

388
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,395
of section 1.1 in these notes.

389
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:25,900
So 1.1.

390
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,600
And actually, I'll
tell you literally

391
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,980
what happened earlier this year.

392
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,510
I had finished this.

393
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,830
I wrote this down with
a different example.

394
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,290
And then I realized
something, that sitting here

395
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,850
in front of me was the
first great theorem

396
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:55,030
in linear algebra, the fact that
the column rank equals the row

397
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,700
rank.

398
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,980
The fact that if I
have a matrix where

399
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,750
that column plus that
column gives that one.

400
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,250
Oh.

401
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,120
So what am I going to say here?

402
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,920
I'm getting nervous about it.

403
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,070
I believe that a combination
of the rows gives 0.

404
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,570
Do you believe that?

405
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,830
You've got to believe it.

406
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,120
This is linear algebra.

407
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,410
The matrix is not
invertible, it's square.

408
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,020
But the columns are dependent.

409
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,800
So the rows have
to be dependent.

410
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,230
And I don't exactly see--

411
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,280
there's some combination
of that row and that row

412
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,080
that gives that one.

413
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,390
And of course, when I
looked at the first column,

414
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,980
I thought, OK, it's
going to be too easy.

415
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,810
One of that and one
of that gives that.

416
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,320
But then my eye went over
to the second column,

417
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,850
and I realized it's
not easy at all.

418
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,810
So you're entitled to pull out
your phone and figure this out.

419
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,894
But there is some damn
combination of those--

420
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:08,136
[LAUGHTER]

421
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:11,220
--of those two rows that
gives the third row.

422
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,900
Otherwise, the course
is over, we stop.

423
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,580
Well, and maybe we're
going to find somehow.

424
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,050
So this is the theorem.

425
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,880
So I have to tell you,
I was really pleased.

426
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,450
So the first two pages
got two more pages

427
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,910
to follow up on that
idea, that here, we

428
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,710
were seeing something that--

429
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,400
I proved in 18.06, but not
in the first lecture, that's

430
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,330
for sure, and not
maybe so clearly.

431
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,310
But now I can try to prove it.

432
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,890
There won't be a lot of
proofs in this class,

433
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,650
but this is such
an important fact--

434
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,590
A equals CR is an
important factorization.

435
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:06,730
And out of it, we
can connect them.

436
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,650
So what am I saying?

437
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,445
I am saying that all--

438
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,550
so what's the row rank?

439
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,110
I have to back up here.

440
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,690
What's the row rank?

441
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,160
What's the row space?

442
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,740
So the row rank is going to be
the dimension of that space.

443
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,040
So I look at my matrix A.
What's the row space of A?

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,590
I'm going to look at its rows.

445
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,760
Now, maybe just so we
don't get whole new letters

446
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,750
for the row space--

447
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,540
for me, the row space
of A of a matrix--

448
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,180
so first of all, tell
me in words what it is.

449
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,072
What's the row
space of the matrix?

450
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:00,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

451
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,960
GILBERT STRANG: All
combinations of the rows.

452
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,520
All combinations of the
rows, that's the space.

453
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,960
So I would take all
combinations of those rows.

454
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,930
To get combinations
of the rows--

455
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,630
well, two ways I can get
combinations of the rows.

456
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:25,250
And the way I'll do it is,
I'll just transpose the matrix.

457
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,730
So those rows become
columns, and then I'm

458
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,770
back to what I did.

459
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:36,850
So the row space of A is the
column space of A transpose.

460
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,920
And this has the
advantage that we

461
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,260
don't introduce a new letter.

462
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,560
So it'll be the column
space of A transpose.

463
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,780
So we don't introduce
a new letter.

464
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,600
We keep the convention
that vectors

465
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,990
are column vectors, which
would be the MATLAB and Julia

466
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,730
and Python convention.

467
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,290
So is that OK?

468
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,020
The row space is the
combination of these rows.

469
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,840
But I'll flip-- I'll
make them stand up--

470
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,470
2, 1, 3-- to be column vectors.

471
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,630
So it's a totally
different space.

472
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:22,520
And actually, I happened to
take a three by three example,

473
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,320
so that the column
space is part of R3

474
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,780
and the row space
is also part of R3.

475
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,270
Because my matrix
is three by three.

476
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,980
A better example-- and the
whole point of data-- data

477
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,770
doesn't come in square matrices.

478
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,420
Fortunately for us, data very,
very often comes in matrices.

479
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,125
But the two-- the
columns might be sample,

480
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:51,050
it might be patients,
and the rows

481
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,530
might be diseases or something.

482
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,540
They're different spaces.

483
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:03,820
So matrices are not
likely to be square.

484
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,120
But anyway, we're good here.

485
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,640
So the row space.

486
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,310
Now can I come
back to the proof?

487
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,170
Because what I want to
say is that the proof

488
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,800
of this fundamental
fact is staring at us,

489
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,860
but we don't quite see it yet.

490
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,620
And I want to see it.

491
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:37,745
So I claim that these rows
are a basis for the row space.

492
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,450
And we already saw
that these columns are

493
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,690
a basis for the column space.

494
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,940
And two equals two, right?

495
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,740
Two vectors here were a
basis for the column space.

496
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,820
Now if I can see why it shows
me that these two vectors are

497
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,110
a basis for the row
space, then my example

498
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,830
is right, that both of
these will give two.

499
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,320
The column rank is
two, two columns,

500
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,210
the row rank is two, two rows.

501
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,050
I have to explain why I
believe that these two rows are

502
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,040
a basis for the row space.

503
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,822
Are you with me?

504
00:30:31,822 --> 00:30:32,530
I have to prove--

505
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,210
I have to see why.

506
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:39,240
First, so when I say basis,
what do I have to check?

507
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,660
Basis is the critical idea.

508
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,060
I have to check that
they're independent, so I

509
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,770
haven't got too many vectors--

510
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,290
I haven't got any
extra vectors in there.

511
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,760
And I also have to check that
their combinations produce--?

512
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,830
All the rows.

513
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,670
Should I say that again?

514
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,350
Because that's what
I'm going to check.

515
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,475
I'm going to check that
those guys are independent.

516
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:11,458
Well, you can see that
they're independent.

517
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,070
And I'm going to check that
their combinations produce

518
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,370
all three of these rows.

519
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:27,200
We didn't create those
numbers for this purpose,

520
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,150
but what I'm saying
is they work.

521
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:35,860
So I claim that this is a
basis, because what combination

522
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,330
of those two rows would
produce this first row?

523
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,110
Yeah, let me just ask you that.

524
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,440
What numbers should I
multiply these two rows by

525
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,410
to get the first row of A?

526
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,410
AUDIENCE: 2, 1.

527
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,630
GILBERT STRANG: 2 and 1.

528
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,510
And where do you find 2 and 1?

529
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:04,550
It's sitting there in
C. Will it work again?

530
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:10,720
Does three of this plus
one of that give 3, 1, 4?

531
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,190
Yes.

532
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,930
So far, so good.

533
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:19,660
Does five of this and seven of
that-- see, I'm multiplying--

534
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,560
I guess I'm doing matrix
multiplication a backward way

535
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,120
or a different way.

536
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,300
I'm taking combinations of
the rows of the second guy.

537
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,430
The wonderful thing about
matrix multiplication

538
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,220
is you can do it a lot
of ways, it comes out

539
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,590
the same every way, and each
way tells you something.

540
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,950
So five of that row plus seven
of that row, sure enough,

541
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,450
is here.

542
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,595
Do you see that that
is not accident?

543
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,100
The proof is really to look
at this multiplication,

544
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,680
C times R, two ways.

545
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,800
Look at it first as
combinations of columns of C

546
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,380
to give the columns.

547
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,100
Look at it second to get as
combinations of the rows of R,

548
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,750
and that produces the rows.

549
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:19,910
So that factorization A
equals CR was the key idea.

550
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:32,690
And actually, this R that
we've come up with has a name.

551
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,770
Anybody remember enough 18.06?

552
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,690
Have you all taken 18.06?

553
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,310
No.

554
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,660
I see-- how many have?

555
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,240
Yes.

556
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,940
OK.

557
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,440
Good.

558
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,540
For a while, 18.06 was taught
in a very abstract way.

559
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,980
I said, what's going on?

560
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,120
But anyway, so if you
took it that semester,

561
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,210
you maybe never heard
of the column space.

562
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm not sure.

563
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,630
Or by a different name.

564
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,070
It has another name.

565
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,840
What's its other name?

566
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,579
The column space of a matrix?

567
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,010
Range-- I think it's the range.

568
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,600
Yeah.

569
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,460
And of course, all this is
fundamental in mathematics.

570
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:27,909
So of course, everything
here has different languages

571
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,190
and different emphasis.

572
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,310
But you see what the
emphasis is here.

573
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,080
So you see the proof,
that A equals CR just

574
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,560
reveals everything.

575
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,199
So it's our first idea of a
factorization of a matrix.

576
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:51,360
And we've multiplied C
times R. I could just say--

577
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,980
so really, you've seen now
the main point of Section 1.1

578
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,750
of the notes to come up
with that factorization

579
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,980
and that conclusion.

580
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,280
And you see why C has
the same number of--

581
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,000
the number of columns of C
equals the number of rows of R,

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,510
and those are the column
rank and the row rank.

583
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,970
Yeah, it's just pretty neat.

584
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,670
And here was the special case
where those the column space is

585
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,730
all multiples of U--
it's a line through U.

586
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,490
The row space is
all multiples of V--

587
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,200
it's a line through V. And
that's the basic building

588
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,700
block.

589
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,820
Can I just say
another little word

590
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,310
before I push on beyond CR?

591
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,970
That this has become--

592
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,800
if you have a giant matrix,
like size 10 to the 5th,

593
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,630
you can't put that
into fast memory.

594
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,870
It's a mess.

595
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,360
How do you deal with a
matrix of size 10 to the 5th,

596
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,670
when you cannot deal
with all the entries?

597
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,030
That's just not possible.

598
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,230
Well, you sample it.

599
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,480
So later in the
course, we'll be doing

600
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,970
random sampling of a matrix.

601
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,460
So how could you
sample a matrix?

602
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,900
So you have a matrix.

603
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,440
Of course you're looking
at it, but it's--

604
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,920
and you want to get
some typical columns.

605
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,240
Here's the natural idea.

606
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,640
You just look at A times x.

607
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,900
Let x be a random vector.

608
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,810
Rand of-- so it's got
m rows and one column.

609
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,440
It's a vector.

610
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,410
And what can I say about Ax?

611
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,623
It's in the-- what
space is it in?

612
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:57,450
AUDIENCE: Column.

613
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,200
GILBERT STRANG: Column space.

614
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,740
Thanks.

615
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,380
That was the first
idea in this lecture.

616
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,120
Ax is in the column space.

617
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,930
So if you want a random
vector in the column space,

618
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,210
I wouldn't suggest
to just randomly pick

619
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,170
one of the columns.

620
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,440
Better to take a
mixture of columns

621
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,520
by taking a random vector
x, and looking at Ax.

622
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,680
And if you wanted
100 random vectors,

623
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,540
you'd take a 100 random
x's, and that would give you

624
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,460
a pretty good idea, in many
cases, of what the column

625
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,290
space looks like.

626
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,410
That would be enough
to work with often.

627
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,370
Can I just throw in
another question?

628
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,030
So Ax is in the
column space of A.

629
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,060
Let me just ask
you this question.

630
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:55,000
Is ABCx-- is that in
the column space of A?

631
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,710
Suppose I have matrices A,
B, and C, and a vector x,

632
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,540
and I take their product.

633
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,420
Does that give me something
in the column space of A?

634
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

635
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,870
GILBERT STRANG:
Yes, good for you.

636
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,126
How do you know that?

637
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

638
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,800
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah,
it's A times something.

639
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,120
Right.

640
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,100
Putting parentheses
in the right place

641
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,050
is the key to linear algebra.

642
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,082
And there it is.

643
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:24,790
It's a question that
just occurred to me.

644
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:29,040
And I thought, well, I
wonder if you'd do it.

645
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,210
So we have still time
to multiply matrices.

646
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,840
Oh, I was going to
say about C and R--

647
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:42,660
so these are real columns
from A. But R is--

648
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,370
the rows are not taken directly
from the rows of A. Actually,

649
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,200
there is a name for this.

650
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,580
It's called the row reduced
echelon form of the matrix,

651
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,880
and it's a big goal in 18.06.

652
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,970
It has the identity there,
and then the other columns

653
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,770
tell you the right combinations.

654
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:15,500
Another big factorization would
be to take columns from A--

655
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,680
so this is another--

656
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,070
so I'll put maybe or--

657
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,810
and we won't be doing
this for a month.

658
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:31,040
We could start to
take columns of A

659
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,550
and put them into C, if
they were independent.

660
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,910
And suppose I took
rows of A. Now I'm

661
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:43,850
going to take literally rows
of A, and put them into R--

662
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,200
well, shall I call it
R twiddle or something,

663
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,260
because it'll be a
different R. I'm not

664
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,850
going to use those rows,
but I'm going to take two

665
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,630
actual rows of A. Then what?

666
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,260
So that's an important
factorization,

667
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,135
but it's not correct.

668
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,620
If I took two other rows
of R, it wouldn't work.

669
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,430
So you have to put it
in the middle some two

670
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,410
by two matrix U that
makes it correct.

671
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:24,310
You'll see in that Section
1.1 that I got excited

672
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,000
and wrote a page about CUR.

673
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,160
Yeah, so I'll just mention that.

674
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,770
So now I'm ready-- oh, I
wanted to say something

675
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,540
about the course.

676
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:43,210
I got excited thinking about
math, but there is this course.

677
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,080
So what's up?

678
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,820
So there'll be linear
algebra problems.

679
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,810
But what makes this course
special is the other homeworks,

680
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,600
which are online.

681
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,235
And you would use--

682
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,590
let's see.

683
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,910
In principle, you could
use any of the languages--

684
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:12,990
MATLAB, Python, which
has become the biggest--

685
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,740
most used for deep
learning, or Julia,

686
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,705
which is the hot, new language.

687
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:28,900
So last time, last
year, the problems--

688
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,290
oh, so what happened last year?

689
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,410
Well, everything
in this course is

690
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,090
owed to a professor who
visited from the University

691
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,740
of Michigan, Professor Rao--

692
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:47,490
Raj Rao, who gave most of
the lectures a year ago,

693
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,580
brought these
homework problems--

694
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,770
online homework
problems, so that people

695
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,950
brought laptops to class
and we did things in class.

696
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,990
So he had and has a
very successful course

697
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,500
at EE in Michigan.

698
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,950
But he was a PhD from here, and
he came back on a sabbatical,

699
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,980
and he created this--
got us started.

700
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,650
And we really owe a lot to him.

701
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,850
Also, Professor Edelman was
involved with this course.

702
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:26,310
And you maybe know
that he created Julia.

703
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,040
How many know what Julia is?

704
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,660
Oh, wonderful.

705
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,920
That will make his day.

706
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,050
He tells me every time I
see him, Julia is good.

707
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,910
And I tell him, I believe it.

708
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,680
[LAUGHTER]

709
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,220
Anyway-- and it's become--

710
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,520
Professor Johnson in
18.06 has used Julia.

711
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,120
And every semester, Steven
Johnson gives in the first week

712
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,440
a tutorial on Julia.

713
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,370
And so that's arranged,
and I promised to tell you

714
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,910
where and when that is.

715
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:08,220
So I think if you don't
know anything about Julia,

716
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,360
try to go.

717
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,250
It's in Stata.

718
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,570
It's on Friday at 5:00--

719
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,140
5:00 to 7:00.

720
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,545
So Julia from Professor Johnson.

721
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,210
So he's done this
multiple times.

722
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,390
He's good at it.

723
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,130
I don't think we know yet what--

724
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,090
I guess I'm hoping that
you'll have an option to use

725
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,170
any of the three languages.

726
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:47,880
But the online thing that we
give you was created in Julia.

727
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,290
So professor Rao had to
learn Julia last spring,

728
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:53,160
and the class did, too.

729
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,740
And there was a certain
amount of bitching about it.

730
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,990
[LAUGHTER]

731
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,750
But I think, with
maybe one exception,

732
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:06,105
who still got an
A, everybody was OK

733
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:08,330
and was glad to learn Julia.

734
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,330
And Professor Rao now
uses Julia entirely.

735
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,650
So he's creating a new
on ramp with Julia.

736
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,920
MATLAB, by the way, has
just issued an on ramp

737
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,450
to deep learning that
I'll tell you about,

738
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,380
and probably get a MATLAB--

739
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,630
somebody from Math Works
to say something about it.

740
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:36,960
So that's what's coming, that
we don't quite know exactly how

741
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,150
well organized those homeworks.

742
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,720
We'll just take the first
one and see what happens.

743
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,990
So I'll certainly say more
about homeworks when--

744
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,610
maybe even Friday.

745
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,282
But are there other questions
that I should answer?

746
00:44:54,282 --> 00:44:55,990
Because some people
will be thinking, OK,

747
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:00,180
am I going to do this or
am I going to sit in 6.036,

748
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,960
or some other course
in deep learning?

749
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,090
Anything on your mind?

750
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,910
And you can email me.

751
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,310
So we will have a Stellar
site and you'll see all the--

752
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,550
the TAs are still to be named.

753
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:17,970
But the wonderful thing is
that the undergraduates who

754
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,080
took this course last
year are volunteering

755
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,170
to be graders for you guys.

756
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,990
So they will know what those
online homeworks were about.

757
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:37,860
So that's a first word
about what's coming

758
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,670
and about the language.

759
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:47,160
I'm going to finish by
a very important topic,

760
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,050
multiplying A times B.
Oh, look, a clean board.

761
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:57,110
So now I want to multiply
a matrix by a vector.

762
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,680
Everybody knows how to do it.

763
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:07,650
You take a row of A--
so you take a row of A

764
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:13,330
and you take a column of B,
and you take the dot product.

765
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:14,720
So you get a dot product.

766
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,380
Row dot column.

767
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:30,180
That's, again, low
level, OK for beginners.

768
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,510
But we want to see that matrix
multiplication, AB, in a deeper

769
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,250
way.

770
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,840
And the deeper way
is columns times row.

771
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:48,060
Columns of A, rows of
B. Columns times row.

772
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,950
Oh, we had a column times a row.

773
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,355
That was this rank one example.

774
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,040
We had a column times a row,
and it produced a matrix.

775
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
And that's what it looked like.

776
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,600
And its rank was one.

777
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,890
So those are what--

778
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,850
so it's a combination of.

779
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,740
It's very like Ax.

780
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,040
I'm really just extending
the Ax idea to AB.

781
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,340
So this is the old way.

782
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,750
The new way is columns.

783
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,150
So there's column
K. It will multiply.

784
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,980
Sure enough, it multiplies
row K. Everybody sees

785
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,420
that it will happen that way.

786
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,210
If you do it the
old way, when you

787
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,540
do a dot product of something
here, something here,

788
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,280
you're doing these
multiplications.

789
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,000
And when you hit column K
here, you hit row K there.

790
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,942
So these are connected.

791
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:08,130
So I get things like column
K of A times row K of B.

792
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:10,010
And I don't know
what notation to use,

793
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,430
so I just wrote the words.

794
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:21,000
But now that's one piece
of the final answer, AB.

795
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,650
That's a rank one piece.

796
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,570
That's a building block.

797
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:31,920
So I add from K equals 1
column one times row one.

798
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,150
Column one of A times
row one of B plus--

799
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,380
da, da, da, plus column K plus--

800
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:48,500
and of course, I stop at
column n of A times row n of B.

801
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,890
So it's a sum of outer products.

802
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,650
So everybody sees
a sum because I

803
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:05,690
have column one times row
1, column K times row K,

804
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:10,720
column n times row n, and
then I add those pieces.

805
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:17,440
It's just the generalization
of Ax to a matrix B there.

806
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:30,310
So it's a sum of Column K row
K of A row K of B. And maybe,

807
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:34,780
should we check that that
gives us the right answer?

808
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,350
I won't do that here,
but all we're doing

809
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,210
is the same multiplications
in a different order.

810
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,550
Actually, let's just
quit with one minute.

811
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,430
We can figure out how many
multiplications are there.

812
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,760
How many more applications
to do an m by n

813
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,570
matrix A times an
n by p matrix B?

814
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,610
So that's A times B. How
many individual numbers--

815
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:05,180
because this would
determine the cost of it.

816
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,870
How many numbers would we need?

817
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:18,240
Well, suppose we do it the
old way, by inner product,

818
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,440
row times column.

819
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,460
So how many multiplications
to do a row times column

820
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,580
and get one entry in the answer?

821
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,060
n, right?

822
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,070
The row has length
n, the column has

823
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,860
length n, n multiplications.

824
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,800
So that's n.

825
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,150
And now how many of
those do I have to do?

826
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,950
AUDIENCE: mp.

827
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,330
GILBERT STRANG: mp.

828
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,120
Because what's the
size of this answer?

829
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,340
The size of this
answer is m by p.

830
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,225
So if I do it in that old
order, like n multiplication

831
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,310
is to do a dot product.

832
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,250
And I've got this many dot
products in the answer.

833
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,540
So I've mnp multiplied.

834
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,120
Now suppose I do it this way.

835
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:16,440
How many multiplications
to do one of those guys?

836
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,450
To multiply our column by a row?

837
00:51:23,716 --> 00:51:29,291
This is an m by 1,
and this is a 1 by p.

838
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:30,980
One column, one row.

839
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,390
How many multiplications
for that guy?

840
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,530
mp.

841
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,718
And how many of those
rank ones do I have to do?

842
00:51:40,718 --> 00:51:43,640
n.

843
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,940
You got it?

844
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,740
mp times n.

845
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:56,580
Now, the other way
was n times mp.

846
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,330
So it gives the same
answer, mnp multiplication.

847
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,940
In fact, they're exactly the
same multiplications, just

848
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:04,000
a different order.

849
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,500
OK.

850
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,540
We're at 1:55.

851
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,760
Thanks for coming today.

852
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,640
I'll talk more about the
class and about linear algebra

853
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,570
on Friday.

854
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,984
Thank you.
