00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,850
GILBERT STRANG: So I've
worked hard over the weekend.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,150
I figured out what I
was doing last time

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,260
and what I'm doing this
time and improved the notes.

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,060
So you'll get a new set of
notes on the last lecture

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,720
and on this one.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,770
And I kind of got a better
picture of what we're doing.

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,370
And that board is
aiming to describe

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,000
the large picture of what we're
doing last time and this time.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,250
So last time was about changes
in A inverse when A changed.

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,710
This time is about changes
in eigenvalues and changes

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,890
in singular values
when A change.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,340
As you can imagine, this is a
natural important situation.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:20,060
Matrices move, and therefore,
their inverses change,

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,360
their eigenvalues change,
their singular values change.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,870
And you hope for a formula.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:34,620
Well, so we did have a
formula for last time

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,730
for the change in
the inverse matrix.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,300
And I didn't get every u and
v transpose in the right place

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,560
in the video or in the
first version of the notes,

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,040
but I hope that that formula,
that that Woodbury Morrison

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,040
formula will be
correct this time.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,740
So I won't go back
over that part.

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,520
But I realize also there
is another question

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,050
that we can answer when
the change is very small,

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,510
when the change in A is dA
or delta A, a small change.

33
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,590
And that's, of course,
what calculus is about.

34
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,370
So I have to sort of
parallel topics here.

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:46,770
What is the derivative when
the change is infinitesimal?

36
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:55,590
And what is the actual change
when the change is finite size?

37
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,250
So now, let me say what we
can do and what we can't do.

38
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,140
Oh, I'll start out by figuring
out what the derivative is

39
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
for the inverse.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,890
So that's like
completing the last time

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,320
for infinitesimal changes.

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,960
Then I'll move on to changes
in the eigenvalues and singular

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,220
values.

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,330
And there, you cannot
expect an exact formula.

45
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,110
We had a formula that was exact,
apart from any typos, for this.

46
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,790
And we'll find a
formula for this,

47
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,520
and we'll find a formula
for that and for that.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,940
Well, that one will
come from this one.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,580
So this will be a
highlight today.

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,505
How do the eigenvalues change
when the matrix changes?

51
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,710
But we won't be able
to do parallel to this,

52
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,310
we won't be able to--

53
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,770
oh, we will be able to do
something for finite changes.

54
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,490
That's important.

55
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,090
Mathematics would have to
keep hitting that problem

56
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,860
until it got somewhere.

57
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,770
So I won't get an exact
formula for that change.

58
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,000
That's too much.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,030
But I'll get inequalities.

60
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,710
How big that change could be.

61
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,580
What can I say about it?

62
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,769
So these are highly interesting.

63
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,670
May I start with completing
the last lecture?

64
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,400
What is the derivative
of the inverse?

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,420
So I'm thinking here,
so what's the setup?

66
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:38,430
The setup is my matrix
A depends on time, on t.

67
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,030
And it has an inverse.

68
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,940
A inverse depends on t.

69
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,230
And if I know this
dependence, in other words,

70
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,950
if I know dA dt, how the
matrix is depending on t,

71
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,840
then I hope I could
figure out what

72
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,010
the derivative of A inverse is.

73
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,360
We should be able to do this.

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,630
So let me just start with--

75
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,310
it's not hard and it
complements this one

76
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,770
by doing the calculus case,
the infinitesimal change.

77
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,650
So I want to get to that.

78
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,420
I can figure out
the change in A.

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:43,010
And my job is to find the
derivative of A inverse.

80
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:50,720
So here's a handy identity.

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,090
Can I just put this here?

82
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,210
So here's my usual identity.

83
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,890
So as last time, I start
with a finite change

84
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,935
because calculus always
does that, right.

85
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:10,000
It starts with a delta
t and then it goes to 0.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,820
So here I am up at
a full size change.

87
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:24,550
So I think that this is equal to
B inverse A minus B A inverse.

88
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,340
And if it's true, it's
a pretty cool formula.

89
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,190
And, look, it is true, because
over on this right-hand side,

90
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,880
I have B inverse
times A A inverse.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,780
That's the identity.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,640
So that's my B inverse.

93
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,180
And I have the minus, the B
inverse B is the identity.

94
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,230
There's A inverse.

95
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,690
It's good, right?

96
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,180
So from that, well,
I could actually

97
00:06:52,180 --> 00:07:04,240
learn from that the rank of
this equals the rank of this.

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,340
That's a point that I
made from the big formula.

99
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,470
But now, we can see it
from an easy formula.

100
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,440
Everywhere here, I'm
assuming that A and B

101
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,300
are invertible matrices.

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
So when I multiply by
an invertible matrix,

103
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,530
that does not change the rank.

104
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,770
So those have the same ranks.

105
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,650
But I want to get
further than that.

106
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,220
I want to find this.

107
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,380
So how do I go?

108
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,820
How do I go forward
with that job

109
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,350
to find the derivative
of the inverse?

110
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:51,660
Well, I'm going to call
this a change in A inverse.

111
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,015
And over here, I'll
have B will be--

112
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,920
yeah, OK, let's see, am I right?

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,670
Yeah.

114
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,630
So B inverse will be--

115
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:14,680
this is A plus delta A inverse.

116
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,220
And this is-- well,
that's A minus B. So

117
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:29,680
that's really minus delta A.
From A to B is the change.

118
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,429
Here, I'm looking at the
difference A minus B.

119
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,049
So it's minus a change.

120
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,960
And here, I have A inverse.

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:45,640
I haven't done anything
except to introduce this delta

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,240
and get B out of it
and brought delta in.

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,130
Now, I'm going to do calculus.

124
00:08:52,130 --> 00:09:00,220
So I'm thinking of B as
there's a sort of a delta t.

125
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,370
And I'm going to divide
by both sides by delta t.

126
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,830
I have to do this if I want--

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,840
and now, I'll let
delta t go to 0.

128
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,030
So calculus appears.

129
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:27,390
Finally, our-- I won't
say enemy calculus,

130
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,730
but there is a sort
of like competition

131
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,520
between linear
algebra and calculus

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,700
for college mathematics.

133
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,260
Calculus has had far, far
too much time and attention.

134
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,930
It like it gets three
or four semesters

135
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,440
of calculus for people who
don't get any linear algebra.

136
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,260
I'm glad this won't be on the
video, but I'm afraid it will.

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,680
Anyway, of course, calculus
is fine in its place.

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,450
So here's its place.

139
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,270
Now let delta t go to 0.

140
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,010
So what does this
equation become?

141
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,510
Then everybody knows that as
the limit of delta t goes to 0,

142
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,560
I replace deltas by--

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,270
so this delta A divided by
delta t that has a meaning.

144
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,940
The top has a meaning and
the bottom has for me.

145
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,580
But then the limit, it's the
ratio that has a meaning.

146
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,255
So dA by itself, I don't
attach a meaning to that.

147
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:38,790
That's infinitesimal.

148
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,720
It's the limit, so that's why
I wanted a delta over a delta

149
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,160
so I could do calculus.

150
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,070
So what happens now
is delta t goes to 0.

151
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,500
And, of course, as
delta t goes to 0,

152
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,720
that carries delta A to 0.

153
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
So that becomes A inverse.

154
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,390
And what does this approach
as delta t goes to 0?

155
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,710
dA dt with that minus sign.

156
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,650
Oh, I've got to
remember the minus sign.

157
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,890
The minus sign is in here.

158
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,060
So I'm bringing
out the minus sign.

159
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,380
Then this was A
inverse, as we had.

160
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,930
And that's dA dt.

161
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,310
And that's A inverse.

162
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,660
That's our formula,
a nice formula,

163
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,150
which sort of belongs
in people's knowledge.

164
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:38,250
You recognize that if
A was a 1 by 1 matrix,

165
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:45,060
we could call it x, instead of
A. If A was a 1 by 1 matrix x,

166
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,830
then I'm saying the formula
for the derivative of 1

167
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,570
over x, right?

168
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,010
A inverse just 1 by 1
case is just 1 over x.

169
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,120
So the derivative of 1-- or
maybe t, I should be saying.

170
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,580
If A is just t, then the
derivative of 1 over t with

171
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,790
respect to t is....?

172
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,680
Is minus 1 over t squared.

173
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,010
The 1 by 1 case we know.

174
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,330
That's what calculus does.

175
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,640
And now we're able to
do the n by n case.

176
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,520
So that's just like good.

177
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,330
And then it's sort of parallel
to formulas like this, where

178
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,020
this delta A has not gone to 0.

179
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,990
It's full size, but low rank.

180
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,280
That was the point.

181
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,880
Actually, the formula would
apply if the rank wasn't low.

182
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,870
But the interest is
in low rank here.

183
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,130
Are we good for this?

184
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,370
That's really the completion
of last time's lecture

185
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,500
with derivatives.

186
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,530
OK, come back to here, to
the new thing now, lambdas.

187
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,280
Let's focus on
lambdas, eigenvalues.

188
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,960
How does the eigenvalue change
when the matrix changes?

189
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,960
How does the eigenvalue change
when the matrix changes?

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,150
So I have two possibilities.

191
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,860
One is small change
when I'm doing calculus

192
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,530
and I'm letting a
delta t go to 0.

193
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,570
The other is full
size, order 1 change,

194
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,130
where I will not
be able to give you

195
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,010
a formula for the
new lambdas, but I'll

196
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,120
be able to tell you
important facts about them.

197
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,240
So this is today's lecture now.

198
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,510
You could say that's the
completion of Friday's lecture.

199
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,600
What about d lambda dt?

200
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,590
It's a nice formula.

201
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,300
Its proof is fun too.

202
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,920
I was very happy
about this proof.

203
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,320
OK, so I guess calculus
is showing up here

204
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
on this middle board.

205
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,910
So how do I start
with the eigenvalues?

206
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,260
Well, start with what I know.

207
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,750
So these are facts,
you could say,

208
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,020
that I have to get the
eigenvalues into it.

209
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,230
And, of course, eigenvalues
have to come with eigenvectors.

210
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,240
So I'll again use A of t.

211
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,350
It will be depending on t.

212
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,290
And an eigenvector
that depends on t

213
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,350
is an eigenvalue that
depends on t times

214
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,036
and eigenvector
that depends on t.

215
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:36,990
Good?

216
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,580
That's fact one that we plan to
take the derivative of somehow.

217
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,650
There's also a second fact
that comes into play here.

218
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,520
What's the deal on the
eigenvalues of A transpose?

219
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,270
They are the same.

220
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,490
The eigenvalues of A
transpose are the same

221
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,110
as the eigenvalues of A.

222
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,690
Are the eigenvectors the same?

223
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,860
Not usually.

224
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,500
Of course, if the
matrix was symmetric,

225
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,150
then A and A transpose
are just the same thing.

226
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:13,620
So A transpose would
have that eigenvalue--

227
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,160
eigenvector.

228
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,850
But, generally, it has
a different eigenvector.

229
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,890
And really to keep a sort
of separate from this one,

230
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,530
let's call it y.

231
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,970
It will have the
same eigenvalue.

232
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,590
I'm going to call it y.

233
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,760
But I'm going to make it a row
vector, because A transpose is

234
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,270
what--

235
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,340
instead of writing
down A transpose,

236
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,130
I'm going to stay with
A, but put the eigenvalue

237
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,240
on the left side.

238
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,000
So here's is the eigenvalue--

239
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,260
eigenvector for A on the left.

240
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,680
And it has the same eigenvalue
times that eigenvector.

241
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,100
But that eigenvector is a
row eigenvector, of course.

242
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,230
This is an equality
between rows.

243
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,150
A row times my
matrix gives a row.

244
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,450
So that's the eigenvalues of--

245
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,210
and it has the same eigenvalues.

246
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,650
So this is totally parallel
to that, totally parallel.

247
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,770
And maybe sort of less--

248
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:25,450
definitely less
seen, but it's just

249
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,970
the same thing for A transpose.

250
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,910
Everybody sees that if I
transpose this equation,

251
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,400
then I've got something
that looks like that.

252
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,320
But I'd rather have it this way.

253
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,960
Now, one more fact I need.

254
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,090
There is-- there has to
be some normalization.

255
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,800
What should be the
length of these?

256
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,530
Right now, x could
have any length.

257
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,750
y could have any length.

258
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,360
And there's a natural
normalization,

259
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,890
which is y transpose
times x equal to 1.

260
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,415
That normalizes the two.

261
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:09,160
It doesn't tell me the length
of x or the length of y.

262
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,089
But it tells me, the key
thing, the length of both.

263
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:20,050
So what I've got there is
tracking along one eigenvalue

264
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,480
and its pair of eigenvectors.

265
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
And you're always welcome to
think of the symmetric case

266
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,400
when y and x are the same.

267
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,740
And then I would call them q.

268
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,360
Oh, well, I would call them q
if it was a symmetric matrix.

269
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,850
So if it's a symmetric
matrix, both eigenvectors

270
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,350
would be called q.

271
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,413
And this would be
saying that q is a--

272
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:45,330
AUDIENCE: Unit vector.

273
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,070
GILBERT STRANG:
Unit vector, right.

274
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,640
So this is all stuff we know.

275
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,910
And actually, maybe I should
write it in matrix notation,

276
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,140
because it's important.

277
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,350
That's for one eigenvector.

278
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,650
This is for all of them at once.

279
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,120
Everybody's with it?

280
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
The x's are the columns of x.

281
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,620
And lambda is the diagonal
matrix of lambdas.

282
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,750
And it has to sit on
the right so that it

283
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,190
will multiply those columns.

284
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,120
So this is like all
eigenvectors at once.

285
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,310
What would this one be?

286
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:39,390
This would be like y
transpose A equals A--

287
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,690
AUDIENCE: y transpose inverse?

288
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,110
GILBERT STRANG: y
transpose, yes--

289
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,100
equals-- and probably
these are multiplied--

290
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,460
I feel wrong if I
write y transpose here.

291
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,260
Like here, the x was on
the right and on the left.

292
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:06,310
And I'll-- oh, yeah,
y transpose, yeah.

293
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,110
OK, so what do I put?

294
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,407
Lambda y transpose.

295
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:12,907
Thanks.

296
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,970
And what do I put here?

297
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,200
What does this translate to if
this was for one eigenvector?

298
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,060
For all of them
at once, it's just

299
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,747
going to translate to y
transpose x equal the identity.

300
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,540
This is pretty basic stuff.

301
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,770
But stuff somehow we don't
always necessarily see.

302
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,840
Those are the key facts.

303
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,900
And now, I plan to
take the derivative,

304
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,690
take the derivative
of respect to lambda.

305
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,500
Oh, I can derive one more fact.

306
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,800
So this would be a formula.

307
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,870
This is formula 1.

308
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,210
Formula 1 just says, what do I
get if I hit this on the left

309
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,530
by y transpose?

310
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,560
Can I do that?

311
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:18,960
y transpose of t A of t x
of t equals lambda of t.

312
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,530
That's a number.

313
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:30,090
So I can always bring that out
in front of the inner product

314
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,684
of vector notation.

315
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:37,470
Are you good for that?

316
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,780
I'm pleading like everything
I've done is totally OK.

317
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,660
And now, I have a improvement
to make on this right-hand side,

318
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,110
which is...?

319
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,690
So what is y transpose times x?

320
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,190
AUDIENCE: 1.

321
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,440
GILBERT STRANG: It's 1.

322
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,890
So let's remember that.

323
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,390
It's 1.

324
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,720
So in other words, I have got
a formula for lambda of t.

325
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,070
As time changes,
the matrix changes.

326
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,550
Its eigenvalues change
according to this formula.

327
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,130
Its eigenvectors change
according of this formula.

328
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,760
And its left eigenvectors change
according to that formula.

329
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,990
So everything here
is above board.

330
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,610
And now, what's the point?

331
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,450
The point is I'm going to
find this, the derivative.

332
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,620
So I'm going to take the
derivative of that equation

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,330
and see what I get.

334
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,260
That'll be the formula for the
derivative of an eigenvalue.

335
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,450
And amazingly, it's
not that widely known.

336
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,500
Of course, it's classical,
but it's not always

337
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,210
part of courses.

338
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,160
So this is as time varies,
the matrix varies, A.

339
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,200
And therefore, its
eigenvalues vary,

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
and its eigenvectors vary.

341
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,960
So we're going to
find d lambda dt.

342
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,210
It's one level of
difficulty more

343
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,670
to find dx dt, the
derivative of the eigenvector

344
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,300
or the second derivative
of the eigenvalue.

345
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,570
Those kind of come together.

346
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,470
And I'm not going to go there.

347
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,280
I'm just going to do the
one great thing here--

348
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,020
take the derivative
of that equation.

349
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,080
Shall I do it over there?

350
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,060
So here we go.

351
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,480
So I want to
compute d lambda dt.

352
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,378
And I'm using this
formula for lambda there.

353
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,726
So I've got three
things that depend on t.

354
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:56,290
And I'm taking the
derivative of their product.

355
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,400
So I'm going to use
the product rule.

356
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,440
I'll apply the product
rule to that derivative.

357
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:13,230
Take the derivative of the
first guy times A times x.

358
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:34,330
Take the derivative of the
second guy times the second guy

359
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,010
and the third guy.

360
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:42,990
y transpose of t A of t dx dt.

361
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,920
OK?

362
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,160
We are one minute away
from a great formula.

363
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,790
And I'm really happy if
you allow me to say it.

364
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,710
That that formula comes
by just taking those facts

365
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,670
we know, putting them
together into this expression

366
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,450
that we also know, and
this is like lambda

367
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,470
equals x inverse Ax.

368
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,740
That's a diagonalizing thing
and then taking the derivative.

369
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,820
So what do I get if I
take that derivative?

370
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,677
Well, this term
I'm going to keep.

371
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,010
I'm not going to play with that.

372
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,520
Everybody is clear?

373
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,710
That's a number.

374
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,770
Here's a matrix.

375
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,350
dA dt is a matrix.

376
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,250
I take the derivative
of every entry in A.

377
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,510
Here's its column
vector, its eigenvector.

378
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,770
And here's a row vector.

379
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,150
So row times matrix times
column is a number, 1 by 1.

380
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,040
And actually, that's my answer.

381
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,910
That's my answer.

382
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:15,080
So I'm saying that these two
terms cancel each other out

383
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,000
as those two terms
added to zero.

384
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,060
This is the right answer
for the derivative.

385
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,640
That's a nice formula.

386
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,250
So to find the derivative
of an eigenvalue,

387
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,500
the matrix is changing, you
multiply by the eigenvector

388
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,260
and by the left eigenvector.

389
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,960
It gives you a number.

390
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,220
And that's the d lambda dt.

391
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,060
So why do those
two guys add to 0?

392
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,280
That's all that remains here.

393
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,240
And then this topic is ended
with this nice formula.

394
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,840
So I want to simplify that,
simplify that, and show

395
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,150
that they cancel each other.

396
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,950
So what is Ax?

397
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,520
It's lambda x.

398
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,910
So this guy is nothing
but it's lambda

399
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:23,430
that depends on time of course
times dy dt dy transpose dt.

400
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,685
I'm just copying that.

401
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:27,520
Ax is lambda x.

402
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,590
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make that look hard.

403
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,310
You OK with that?

404
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,110
Ax is lambda x.

405
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,010
And I am perfectly safe,
because lambda is just a number

406
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,670
to bring it out to the left.

407
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,870
So it doesn't look
like it's in the way.

408
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,220
And what about this other term?

409
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,150
So I have y transpose--

410
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,090
oh, y transpose A, what's that?

411
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,980
What's y transpose A?

412
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,770
That's the combination
that I know.

413
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:09,320
y transpose A, y is that
left eigenvalue. y transpose

414
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,150
A brings out a lambda.

415
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:19,390
So this also brings out a lambda
times y transpose times dx dt.

416
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,020
OK?

417
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,400
I just use Ax equal
lambda x there.

418
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,670
It was really nothing.

419
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,990
Now, what do I do?

420
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,460
I want this to be 0.

421
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,170
Can you see it happening?

422
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,600
It's a great pleasure
to see it happening.

423
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,060
So what do I have here?

424
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,248
What's my first step now?

425
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:45,490
AUDIENCE: Like take lambda--

426
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,170
GILBERT STRANG:
Bring lambda outside.

427
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,130
That's not 0.

428
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,780
We don't know what that is.

429
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,240
Bring lambda outside there
times the whole thing.

430
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,040
So for some wonderful
reason I believe

431
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,240
that this number, which is
a row times a column, a row

432
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,540
times a column,
two terms there, I

433
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,170
believe they knock each other
out and that result is 0.

434
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,024
And why?

435
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:18,070
Why?

436
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,980
Because I come back to--

437
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,710
this board has all that I know.

438
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,490
And here's y transpose
times x equal 1.

439
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,330
And how does that help me?

440
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:34,782
Because what I'm seeing in that
square, in those brackets is?

441
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,490
AUDIENCE: The derivative
of y transpose--

442
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,850
GILBERT STRANG: The derivative
of the y transpose x.

443
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,750
So it's the derivative of?

444
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,250
AUDIENCE: 1

445
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,000
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

446
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,170
Therefore, 0.

447
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,430
So this is the derivative of 1.

448
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,490
It equals 0.

449
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,130
Those two terms
knock each other out

450
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,650
and leave just the nice
term that we're seeing.

451
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,380
So the derivative
of the eigenvalue,

452
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,690
just to have one more look
at it before we leave it.

453
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,120
The derivative of the
eigenvalue is this formula.

454
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
It's the rate at
which the matrix

455
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,120
is changing times the
eigenvectors on right and left.

456
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,170
Sometimes they're called
the right eigenvector

457
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,880
and the left eigenvector
at the time t.

458
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,260
So we're not saying
in this d lambda dt.

459
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,930
In other words, I
get a nice formula,

460
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,170
which doesn't involve the
derivative of the eigenvector.

461
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,120
That's the beauty of it.

462
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,650
If I want to go up to
take the next step--

463
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,580
I tried this weekend,
but it's a mess.

464
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,310
It would be to take the--

465
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,640
so this is my formula then,
d lambda dt equals this.

466
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,240
And I can take the next
derivative of that,

467
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,350
and it will involve
d second dt squared.

468
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:05,400
But it will also
involve dx dt and dy dt.

469
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,230
And in fact, a pseudo
inverse even shows up.

470
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:18,060
It's another step, and I'm not
going that far, because we've

471
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,570
got the best formula there.

472
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:29,620
So now that has
answered this question.

473
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,440
And I could answer that
question the same way.

474
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,750
It would involve A transpose
A and the singular vectors,

475
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,190
instead of involving A
and the eigenvectors.

476
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,068
Maybe that's a
suitable exercise.

477
00:30:45,068 --> 00:30:45,610
I don't know.

478
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,380
I haven't done it myself.

479
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:53,560
What I want to do
is this, now say,

480
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,590
what can we say about the
change in the eigenvalue--

481
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,670
and I'll just stay first
of all with eigenvalue--

482
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:08,040
when the change is like rank 1?

483
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,830
This is a perfect example
when the change is rank 1.

484
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:26,350
So what can we say
about the eigenvalues--

485
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,330
let's take the top, the largest
eigenvalue, or all of them,

486
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,390
all of them, lambda
j, all of them--

487
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:44,490
of A plus a rank 1
matrix uv transpose.

488
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:53,110
Oh, let's do the nice
case here, the nice case,

489
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,000
because if I allow a general
matrix A, I have to worry about

490
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
does it have enough
eigenvectors?

491
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,150
Can it diagonalize?

492
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,220
All that stuff.

493
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,815
Let's make it a
symmetric matrix.

494
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,500
And let's make the rank
1 change symmetric too.

495
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,320
So the question is, what can
I say about the eigenvalues

496
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,670
after a rank 1 change?

497
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,520
So again, this
isn't calculus now,

498
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,370
because the change
that I'm making

499
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:32,520
is a true vector and
not a differential.

500
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,340
And I'm not going to
have an exact formula

501
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,670
for the new
eigenvalues, as I said.

502
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:46,380
But what I am going to do is
write down the beautiful facts

503
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,100
that are known about that.

504
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,760
And here they are.

505
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,930
So, first of all,
the eigenvalues

506
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,130
are in descending order.

507
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,040
We use descending order
for singular values.

508
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,170
Let's use them also
for eigenvalues.

509
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,400
So lambda 1 is greater
or equal to lambda 2,

510
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,230
greater or equal to
lambda 3, and so on.

511
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,870
Oh, give me-- give me an idea.

512
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:26,690
What do you expect from
that rank 1 change?

513
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,870
So that change is rank 1.

514
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,330
Can you tell me any more about
that change, u u transpose?

515
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:36,337
What kind of a matrix
is u u transpose?

516
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,300
It's rank 1, but
we can say more.

517
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,480
It is...?

518
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,110
AUDIENCE: Symmetrical.

519
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,290
GILBERT STRANG:
Symmetric, of course.

520
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,140
And it is...?

521
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,640
Yeah?

522
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,973
AUDIENCE: Positive semidefinite.

523
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:53,100
GILBERT STRANG:
Positive semidefinite.

524
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,480
Positive semidefinite.

525
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,465
This is a positive change.

526
00:33:56,465 --> 00:34:03,265
u u transpose is the typical
rank 1 positive semidefinite.

527
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:04,640
It couldn't be
positive definite,

528
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,950
because it's only got rank 1.

529
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,460
What's the eigenvector
of that matrix?

530
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's just-- why not here?

531
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,199
We can do this in two seconds.

532
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,830
So u u transpose,
that's the matrix

533
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,020
I'm asking you to think about.

534
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,219
And it's a full n by n
matrix, column times a row.

535
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,690
Tell me an eigenvector
of that matrix.

536
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,190
Yes?

537
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,820
AUDIENCE: u.

538
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,570
GILBERT STRANG: u.

539
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:35,190
If I multiply my matrix by
u, I get-- what do I get?

540
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,969
I get some number times u.

541
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,770
And what is that number lambda?

542
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,600
AUDIENCE: u transpose u.

543
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,570
GILBERT STRANG: That lambda
happens to be u transpose u.

544
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,280
So that's different
from u u transpose.

545
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,760
This is a matrix.

546
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,030
This is 18.065 now.

547
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,650
That's a number.

548
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,540
And what can you tell
me about that number?

549
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,290
It is...?

550
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,060
AUDIENCE: Greater
than or equal to 0.

551
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,290
GILBERT STRANG: Greater--
well, even more.

552
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,670
Greater than 0.

553
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,090
Greater, because this
is a true vector here.

554
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,250
So this is greater than 0.

555
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,920
It's the only eigenvalue--
all the other eigenvalues

556
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,440
of that rank 1 matrix are zero.

557
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,740
But the one non-zero eigenvalue
is over on the plus side.

558
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,580
It's u transpose u.

559
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,510
We all recognize that as
the length of u squared.

560
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,540
It's certainly positive.

561
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,690
So we do have a positive
semidefinite definite matrix.

562
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:39,760
What would your guess be of the
effect on the eigenvalues of A?

563
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,230
So I'm coming back
to my real problem--

564
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,080
eigenvalues of S,
sorry, S. Symmetric

565
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,240
matrices, I'm saying symmetric.

566
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,090
What is your guess if I
have a symmetric matrix

567
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,960
and I add on u u transpose?

568
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,840
What do you imagine that
does to the eigenvalues?

569
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,340
You're going to get it right.

570
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,120
Just say it.

571
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,320
What happens to the eigenvalues
of S if I add on u u transpose?

572
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,100
They will...?

573
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,380
AUDIENCE: More positive.

574
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,330
GILBERT STRANG: They'll
be more positive.

575
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,300
They'll go up.

576
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,970
This is a positive thing.

577
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,320
It's like adding
17 to something.

578
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,920
It moves up.

579
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,010
So therefore, what
I believe is--

580
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,590
so I've got two sets
of eigenvalues now.

581
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,170
One is the eigenvalues of s.

582
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,650
The other is the different
eigenvalues of S.

583
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,190
So I can't call them both
lambdas or I'm in trouble.

584
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,540
So do you have a favorite
other Greek letter

585
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,310
for the eigenvalues of S?

586
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,430
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

587
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,000
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma.

588
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,215
OK, gamma.

589
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,590
As long as you
say a Greek letter

590
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,630
that I have some
idea how to write.

591
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,710
Zeta, it seems to me, is like
the world's toughest letter

592
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,220
to write.

593
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,300
And electrical engineers
can coolly flush off a zeta.

594
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,440
I've never succeeded.

595
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,260
So I'll write--
what did you say?

596
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,070
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

597
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,980
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma
j of the original.

598
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,150
So those are the
eigenvalues of the original.

599
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,580
These are the eigenvalues
of the modified.

600
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,130
And we're expecting the lambdas
to be bigger than the gammas.

601
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,200
So that's just a
qualitative statement.

602
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,410
And it's true.

603
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:44,190
Each lambda is bigger
than the gamma.

604
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,600
Sorry, yeah, yeah, each
lambda, by adding this stuff,

605
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,390
the lambdas are bigger than--
so I'll just write that.

606
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,040
Lambdas are bigger than gammas.

607
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:07,840
And that's a fundamental
fact, which we could prove.

608
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,880
But a little more is known.

609
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,450
Of course, the question
is, how much bigger?

610
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:17,770
How much can they be way bigger?

611
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,540
Well, I don't believe
they could be bigger

612
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,680
by more than that number myself.

613
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,250
But there's just
better news than that.

614
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,550
So the lambdas are
bigger than the gammas.

615
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,540
So lambda 1 is
bigger than gamma 1.

616
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:41,800
So this is the S plus
u u transpose matrix.

617
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,160
And these are the
eigenvalues of the S matrix.

618
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,260
Lambda 1 is bigger than gamma 1.

619
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,450
But look what's happening
in this line of text here.

620
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,640
I'm saying that gamma 1--

621
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,150
that lambda 2 is
smaller than gamma 1.

622
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,410
Isn't that neat?

623
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,960
The eigenvalues go up.

624
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,752
But they don't just
like go anywhere.

625
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,135
And that's called interlacing.

626
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,240
So this is one of those
wonderful theorems that

627
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:34,140
makes your heart happy, that
if I do I rank one change

628
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,580
and it's a positive change,
then the eigenvalues increase,

629
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,880
but they don't increase--

630
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,800
the new eigenvalue is below
the new second eigenvalue.

631
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,280
It doesn't pass up the
old, first eigenvalues.

632
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,150
And the new third
eigenvalue doesn't pass up

633
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,380
the old second eigenvalue.

634
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,690
So that's the
interlacing theorem

635
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,490
that's associated with the
names of famous math guys.

636
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,900
And of course you have
to say that's beautiful.

637
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,350
While we're writing
down such a theorem,

638
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,930
make a guess of what
the theorem would

639
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:23,280
be if I do a rank 2 change.

640
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:31,220
Suppose I do an S,
staying symmetric.

641
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,200
And I do a rank 1 change.

642
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,770
But then I also do a rank 2
change, say w w transpose.

643
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,830
So what's the deal here?

644
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:50,370
What do I know about the change
matrix, the delta S here?

645
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,840
I know its rank is 2.

646
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,230
I'm assuming u and w are
not in the same direction.

647
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,990
So that's a rank 2 matrix.

648
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,120
And what can you tell me about
the eigenvalues of that rank 2

649
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,620
matrix?

650
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,630
So it's got n eigenvalues
because it's an n by n matrix.

651
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,160
But how many non-zero
eigenvalues has it got?

652
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,926
Two, because its rank is 2.

653
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:21,140
The rank tells you the number
of non-zero eigenvalues

654
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,540
when matrices are symmetric.

655
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,990
It doesn't tell you enough.

656
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,720
If matrices are unsymmetric,
eigenvalues can be weird.

657
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,710
So stay symmetric here.

658
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,010
So this has two
non-zero eigenvalues.

659
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,110
And can you tell me their sign.

660
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,140
Is that matrix
positive semidefinite?

661
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,700
Yes, of course, it is.

662
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,600
Of course.

663
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,350
So this was and this was.

664
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,860
And together it certainly is.

665
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:59,160
So now, I've added a rank 2
positive semidefinite matrix.

666
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,890
And now, I'm not going
to rewrite this line,

667
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,530
but what would you
expect to be true?

668
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,140
You would expect that
the eigenvalues increase.

669
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:16,610
But how big could gamma--

670
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,360
yeah, so gamma 2,
let's follow gamma 2.

671
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,470
Well, maybe I
should use another--

672
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,070
do the Greeks have any other
letters than lambda and gamma.

673
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,253
They must had--

674
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:30,960
AUDIENCE: Zeta.

675
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,793
GILBERT STRANG: Who?

676
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:33,420
C?

677
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,760
Hell with that.

678
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,150
Who knows one I can write?

679
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,920
AUDIENCE: Alpha.

680
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,837
GILBERT STRANG: Alpha.

681
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:39,600
Good, alpha.

682
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,620
Yes, alpha.

683
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,220
Right.

684
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:50,615
So alpha is the eigenvalues
of this rank 2 change.

685
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,420
OK.

686
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,000
Now, what am I going
to be able to say?

687
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,400
Can I say anything about the--

688
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,640
well, of course, alpha 1
is bigger than lambda 1,

689
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,860
which was bigger than--

690
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,140
eigenvalues are going up, right?

691
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,270
I'm adding positive definite
or positive semidefinite stuff.

692
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,500
There's no way eigenvalues
can start going down on me.

693
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,000
So alpha 1 is a greater
or equal to the lambda

694
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,180
1, which had just a
rank 1 change, which

695
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,280
is greater or equal to the--

696
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,230
mu, was it mu?

697
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,353
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

698
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:35,270
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma.

699
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:42,140
Gamma 1, and so on.

700
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:50,370
OK, now, let's see, is
gamma 1 bigger than alpha--

701
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,050
what am I struggling
to write down here?

702
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:57,160
What could I say?

703
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,170
Well, what can I
say that reflects

704
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:07,440
the fact that this lambda 2--

705
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,200
or sorry, so gamma 1 went up.

706
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,150
Gamma 1 was bigger
than lambda 2.

707
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:15,890
That was the point here.

708
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,050
Gamma 1 is bigger.

709
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,540
So this was a sort of easy,
because I'm adding stuff.

710
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,830
I expected the lambda to go up.

711
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,660
This is where the theorem
is that it didn't go up

712
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,830
so far as to pass--

713
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:32,240
or sorry, the lambda
2, which went up,

714
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,180
didn't pass up gamma 1.

715
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,580
Lambda 2 didn't pass up gamma 1.

716
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,850
And now let me write
those words down.

717
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:45,170
Now the alpha 2--

718
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,260
well, could alpha
2 pass up lambda 1?

719
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,000
And what about alpha 3?

720
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,680
Let me say what I believe.

721
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:08,020
I think alpha 2, which is like
1 behind, but I'm adding rank 2,

722
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,270
I think alpha 2 could
pass up lambda 1.

723
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,440
It could pass lambda 1.

724
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,270
But alpha 3 can't.

725
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:21,260
I believe that alpha 3 is
smaller than lambda 1--

726
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,300
smaller than gamma
1, the original.

727
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,960
Got it.

728
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

729
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,680
Anyway, I'll get it
right in the notes.

730
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,290
You know what
question I'm asking.

731
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,860
And for me, that's
the important thing.

732
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,560
Now, there is a little
matter of why is this true?

733
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,460
This is the good case.

734
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,700
Let me give you another
example of interlacing.

735
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,810
Can I do that?

736
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,830
It really comes
from this, but let

737
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,220
me give you another example
that's just striking.

738
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:10,390
So I have a symmetric
matrix, n by n.

739
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:18,260
Call it S. And then I throw
away the last row and column.

740
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,875
So in here is S n minus 1.

741
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:24,250
The big matrix was Sn.

742
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,516
This one is of size n minus 1.

743
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,900
So it's got sort of
less degrees of freedom,

744
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,370
because the last degree
of freedom got removed.

745
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,040
And what do you think
about the eigenvalues

746
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,670
of the n minus 1
eigenvalues of this

747
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,670
and the n eigenvalues of that?

748
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,740
They interlace.

749
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,370
So this has eigenvalue lambda 1.

750
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:57,990
This would have an
eigenvalue smaller than that.

751
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:01,710
This would have an
eigenvalue lambda 2.

752
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:06,900
This would have an eigenvalue
smaller than that and so on.

753
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,120
Just the same
interlacing and basically

754
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,850
for the same reason,
that when you--

755
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,440
this reduction to
size n minus 1 is

756
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,070
like I'm saying xn has
to be 0 in the energy

757
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,380
or any of those expression.

758
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:32,370
And the fact of making xn be 0
is like one constraint, taking

759
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,380
one degree of freedom away.

760
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,220
It reduces the eigenvalues,
but not by two.

761
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:44,180
OK, now I have
one final mystery.

762
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,650
And let me try to tell you what.

763
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,750
It worried me.

764
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,070
Now what is it that worried me?

765
00:47:55,070 --> 00:48:06,350
Yes, suppose this change, this
u, this change that I'm making,

766
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:11,930
suppose it's actually the
second eigenvector of S.

767
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,325
So can I write this down?

768
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:26,180
Suppose u is actually the
second eigenvector of S.

769
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,370
What do I mean by that?

770
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,350
So I mean that S times
u is lambda 2 times u.

771
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,530
Now, I'm going to change it.

772
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:45,860
S plus u u transpose, that's
what I've been looking at.

773
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,580
And that moves the
eigenvalues up.

774
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,010
But what worries me is
like if I multiply this

775
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:57,550
by 20, some big
number, I'm going

776
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:03,340
to move that eigenvalue
way up, way past.

777
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:08,900
I got worried about
this inequality.

778
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:17,090
When I add this, that same
u is lambda 2 plus 20 u.

779
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,120
Su is lambda 2u.

780
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,350
And this 20 is 20.

781
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,490
u is a unit vector.

782
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,380
So you see my worry?

783
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,460
Here, I'm doing a rank 1 change.

784
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:39,080
But it's moved an
eigenvalue way, way up.

785
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:45,650
So how could this
statement be true?

786
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,330
So I've just figured
out here what gamma--

787
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,170
well, do you see my question?

788
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:57,680
I could leave it as a
question to answer next time.

789
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,170
Let me do that.

790
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,620
And I'll put it online
so you'll see it clearly.

791
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:11,290
It looks like and it happens
this eigenvector now has

792
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,710
eigenvalue lambda 2 plus 20.

793
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:19,170
Why doesn't that blow
away this statement?

794
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,360
I'll put that, because it's sort
of coming with minus 10 seconds

795
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:29,280
to go in the class, so let's
leave that and a discussion

796
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,100
of this for next time.

797
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,320
But I'm happy with this
lecture if you are.

798
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,670
Last lecture I got
u's and v's mixed up.

799
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,500
And it's not reliable.

800
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,940
Here, I like the
proof of the lambda dt

801
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,800
and we're started
on this topic 2.

802
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,300
Good.

803
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,150
Thank you.
