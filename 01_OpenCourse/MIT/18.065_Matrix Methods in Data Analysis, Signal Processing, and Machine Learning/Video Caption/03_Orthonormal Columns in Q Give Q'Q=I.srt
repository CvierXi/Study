8
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,160
PROFESSOR: So
we're really moving

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,550
along this review of the
highlights of linear algebra.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,460
And today it's matrices Q.
They get that name there.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,500
They have orthonormal columns.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,020
So that's what one looks like.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,920
And then the key fact,
orthonormal columns

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,100
translates directly into that
simple fact that you just

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,400
keep remembering every
time you see Q transpose Q,

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,390
you've got the identity matrix.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,820
Let's just see why.

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,410
So Q transpose would be--

19
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,135
I'll take those columns
and make them into rows.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,250
And then I multiply
by Q with the columns.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,830
And what do I get?

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,050
Well hopefully, I get
the identity matrix.

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,830
Why?

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,510
Because-- oh yeah, the normal
part tells me that the length

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,800
of each vector--

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,190
that's the length
squared Q transpose Q--

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,650
the length squared is one.

28
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,190
So that gives me the one
in the identity matrix

29
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,900
all along the diagonal.

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,040
And then Q transpose times
a different Q is zero.

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,050
That's the ortho part.

32
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,510
So that gives me the zeros.

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,290
So that's a simple
identity, but it

34
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:55,700
translates from a lot of words
into a simple expression.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:02,130
Now does that mean that in the
other order, Q, Q transpose,

36
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,810
is that the identity?

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,810
So that's a question
to think about.

38
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,680
Is Q, Q transpose
equal the identity?

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,420
Question, sometimes
yes, sometimes no--

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,025
easy to tell which.

41
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:28,830
If the answer is yes, yes when
Q is square, the answer is yes.

42
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,640
If Q is a square m
a square matrix--

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,550
this is saying that
a square matrix

44
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,750
Q has that inverse on its left.

45
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,450
But for square matrices,
a left inverse,

46
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,800
Q transpose is also
a right inverse.

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,490
So for a square
matrix, if you have

48
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,210
an inverse that
works on one side,

49
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,480
it will work on the other side.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,180
So the answer is
yes in that case.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,720
And then in that case, that's
the case when we call Q is--

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,740
well, we really--

53
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,330
I don't know what
the right name would

54
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,300
be, but here is the
name everybody uses,

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,695
an orthogonal matrix.

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,900
And that's only in their
square case, square.

57
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,330
Q is an orthogonal matrix.

58
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,060
Do you want to just see an
example of how that works?

59
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,670
So if Q is rectangular--

60
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,500
let me do a rectangular
Q and a square Q.

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,530
So I think there must be a
board up there somewhere.

62
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,030
Here.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,770
OK, square.

64
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,730
All right.

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,782
Good to see some
orthogonal matrices,

66
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,240
because my message
is that they are

67
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,340
really important in all
kinds of applications.

68
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,220
Let's start two by two.

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,160
I can think of
two different ways

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,320
to get an orthogonal matrix.

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,050
That's a two by two matrix.

72
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,800
And one of them you
will know immediately,

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,970
cos theta sine theta.

74
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,000
So that's a unit vector.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,990
It's normalized.

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,360
Cos squared plus
sine squared is one.

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,250
And this guy has to
be orthogonal to it.

78
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,590
So I'll make that minus
sine theta and cos theta.

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,530
Those are both length
one, they're orthogonal,

80
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,960
then this is my Q.
And the inverse of Q

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,630
will be the transpose.

82
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,900
The transpose would put
the minus sign down here

83
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,180
and would produce
the inverse matrix.

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,970
And what is that particular
matrix represent?

85
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,110
Geometrically, where
do we see that matrix?

86
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,880
It's a rotation, thank you.

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,240
It's a rotation of the
whole plane by theta.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,930
Yeah.

89
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,190
So if I apply that to
one, zero for example,

90
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,600
I get the first column, which
is cos theta sine theta.

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,710
And that's just-- let
me draw a picture.

92
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,270
That vector one, zero has
gotten rotated up to--

93
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,810
so there's the one, zero.

94
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,260
And there, it got rotated
through an angle theta.

95
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,990
And similarly,
zero, one will get

96
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,650
rotated through an
angle theta to there.

97
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,200
So the whole plane rotates.

98
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh, that makes me remember
a highly important,

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,370
very important property of
Q. It doesn't change length.

100
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,260
The length of any vector is
the same after you rotate it.

101
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,100
The length of any vector is the
same after you multiply by Q.

102
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,810
Can I just do that?

103
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,640
I claim any x, any
vector x, I want

104
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,890
to look at the length of Qx.

105
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,630
And I claim it has
the same length as x.

106
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,750
Actually, that's the
reason in computations

107
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,460
that orthogonal matrix
are so much loved,

108
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,330
because no overflow can happen
with orthogonal matrices.

109
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,130
The lengths don't change.

110
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,030
I can multiply by any number
of orthogonal matrices

111
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,820
and the length don't change.

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,960
Can we just see why that's true?

113
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,670
So what do we have to go on?

114
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,740
What we have to go on is
Q transpose Q equal I.

115
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,350
Whatever we're going to prove,
it's got to come out of that,

116
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,260
because that's all we know.

117
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,852
So how do I use that
to get that one?

118
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:55,810
Well, we haven't said a
whole lot about length,

119
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,460
but you'll see it all now.

120
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,120
It'll be easier to prove that
the squares are the same.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,760
So what's the what's
the matrix expression

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,410
for the length squared?

123
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,920
What's the right hand
side of that equation?

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,200
X transpose x, right?

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,560
X transpose x gives me
the sum of the squares.

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,670
Pythagoras says that's
the length squared.

127
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,030
So that right hand
side is x transpose x.

128
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,530
What's the left side?

129
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,810
It's the length
squared of this, of Qx.

130
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,290
So it must be the same
as Qx transpose Qx.

131
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,510
And the claim is that
that equation holds.

132
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,030
And do you see it?

133
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,710
So any property from Q has
to just come out directly

134
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,660
from that.

135
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,430
Where is it here?

136
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,730
Do I just like, push away a
little bit at that left hand

137
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,070
side and see it?

138
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,500
Qx transpose is the same
as x transpose Q transpose.

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
And Qx is Qx.

140
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,560
And now I'm seeing--

141
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,130
well, you might
say, wait a minute.

142
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,650
The parentheses were
there and there.

143
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,160
But I say the most important
law for matrix multiplication

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,560
is you can move parentheses
or throw them away.

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,970
Let's throw them away.

146
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,230
So in here I'm
seeing Q transpose Q,

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,460
which is the identity.

148
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,500
So it's true, yeah.

149
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,830
So that means that you're
never under flow or overflow

150
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,770
when you're multiplying by
Q. Every numerical algorithm

151
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,309
is written to use orthogonal
matrices wherever it can.

152
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,545
And here's the first example.

153
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,260
I think it may be good for
me to think of other examples

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,720
or for us to think
of other examples

155
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,790
of orthogonal matrices.

156
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,360
So I'm using that word
orthogonal matrix.

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,070
We should really be
saying orthonormal.

158
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,230
And I'm really thinking
mostly of square ones.

159
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,550
So in this square case when
Q transpose is Q inverse.

160
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,140
Of course, that fact
makes it easy to solve

161
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,610
all equations that have Q
as a coefficient matrix,

162
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,180
because you want the inverse
and you just use the transpose.

163
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,342
Let's just take some minutes
to think of examples of Q's.

164
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:41,800
If they're so
important, there have

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,560
to be interesting examples.

166
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,450
And that was a first one.

167
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,180
Now there's one more two by two
example that you should know.

168
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,890
Do you know what that would be?

169
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,990
This will be an example two, and
it's also going to be only two

170
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,870
by two and real.

171
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,310
And what possibility
have I got left here?

172
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll use this same first
column, cos theta sine theta,

173
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,620
because that's more or less any
unit vector in two dimensions,

174
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,030
this has got that form.

175
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:25,036
So what do you propose
for the second column?

176
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:25,994
Yes?

177
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:29,347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

178
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:33,550
PROFESSOR: Yeah, put the
minus sign down here.

179
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,890
So you think does that
make any difference?

180
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,240
So sine theta and
minus cos theta.

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,100
I don't know if you've
ever looked at that matrix.

182
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,990
We're trying to collect
together a few matrices that

183
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,050
are worth knowing,
are worth looking at.

184
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,150
Now what's happened here?

185
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,290
You may say that was a trivial
change, which it kind of was.

186
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,150
But it's a different matrix now.

187
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,520
It's not a rotation anymore.

188
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,530
That's not a rotation.

189
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:08,630
And yeah, somehow
now it's symmetric.

190
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:15,300
And yeah, it's eigenvectors
must be something or other.

191
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,670
We'll get to those.

192
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,970
But what does that matrix do?

193
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,680
I don't know if you've seen it.

194
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,190
If you haven't, it doesn't jump
out, but it's a important case.

195
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,960
This is a reflection matrix.

196
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,290
Notice that it's
determinant is minus one.

197
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,500
You have minus cos square
theta, minus sine squared theta.

198
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,940
It's determinant is minus one.

199
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:54,350
There's some eigenvalue
coming up that's got a minus.

200
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,960
So what do I mean by
a reflection matrix?

201
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,265
Let me draw the plane.

202
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,460
So one, zero, let's
follow that, follow again.

203
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,470
One, zero, where does that go?

204
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,950
That gives me the first column.

205
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,800
So as before, it goes
to cos theta sine theta.

206
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,600
And when I say
reflection, let me

207
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,170
put the mirror into
the picture so you

208
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,000
see what reflection it is.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,330
The mirror is along here
at angle theta over two,

210
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,780
theta over two line.

211
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,520
So sure enough, one,
zero at angle zero

212
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,960
got reflected into a unit
vector at angle theta,

213
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,730
and halfway between was
theta over two line.

214
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,300
That's OK.

215
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,590
Now what about the
other guy, zero, one?

216
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,950
Here's zero, one.

217
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,350
I multiply that.

218
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,440
Can I put the zero,
one up here, so your I

219
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
does the multiplication?

220
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,630
Where is the result
of zero, one?

221
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,400
What's the output from
Q applied to zero, one?

222
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,170
Sine theta minus
cos theta, right?

223
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,300
It's the second column.

224
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,990
And so where is that?

225
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, it's perpendicular
to that guy.

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,100
That's what I know.

227
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,970
That was the point, that the
two columns are perpendicular.

228
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,910
So it must go down
this way, right?

229
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,630
Sine theta cos theta.

230
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,970
And it doesn't
change the length.

231
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,690
All these facts that we
just learned are key.

232
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,630
So there's zero, one.

233
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,960
And it goes to this guy, which
is whatever that second column

234
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,190
is sine theta minus cos theta.

235
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,730
And if you check
that, actually, gosh!

236
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,800
This is like plain geometry.

237
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,150
I believe-- it never occurred
to me before-- but I believe it,

238
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,525
that this angle
going down to there,

239
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,850
that that goes straight through,
and that the halfway one

240
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,650
is that line.

241
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,580
Yeah, I think that
picture has got it.

242
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,070
And I think it's in the note.

243
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,390
So that's a reflection matrix.

244
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,650
Well, that's a two by
two reflection matrix.

245
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:45,060
Would you like to see some
other matrices like this one,

246
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,590
but larger?

247
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:53,940
They're named after a
guy named Householder.

248
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,660
So these are
Householder reflections.

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,210
What am I doing here?

250
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,260
I'm collecting together
some orthogonal matrices

251
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,930
that are useful and important.

252
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,530
And Householder found
a whole bunch of them.

253
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,990
And his algorithm
is a much used part

254
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,330
of numerical linear algebra.

255
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,400
So he started with
a unit vector.

256
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,040
Start with a unit vector
u transpose u equal one.

257
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,940
So the length of
the vector is one.

258
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,890
And then he created--

259
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,970
let's name it after him--

260
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,470
H.

261
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,865
He created this matrix,
the identity minus two u,

262
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:42,780
u transpose.

263
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,325
And I believe that that's
a really useful matrix.

264
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,780
I think this review is
like going beyond 18.06,

265
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,230
into what ones are
really worth knowing,

266
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,960
worth knowing individually.

267
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,470
Could we just check what are
the properties of Householders

268
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,200
reflection of that I minus two?

269
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,800
You recognize here a
column times a row.

270
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,690
So that's a matrix.

271
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:27,000
And what could you tell me about
that matrix u, u transpose?

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,810
It's yeah?

273
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,080
What can we say about H?

274
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,540
So I guess I'm believing that
H is a orthogonal matrix,

275
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,160
otherwise it wouldn't
be here today.

276
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,070
So I believe that-- and that
not only is it orthogonal,

277
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,580
it is also--

278
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,940
have a look at it--

279
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,130
symmetric.

280
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,460
It's also symmetric.

281
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,260
The identity is symmetric.

282
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,290
u, u transpose is symmetric.

283
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,380
So this is a family of
symmetric orthogonal matrices.

284
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,109
And that was one of them.

285
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,450
That's a symmetric
orthogonal matrix.

286
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,130
These matrices are
really great to have.

287
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,660
In using linear
algebra, you just

288
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,550
get a collection of useful
matrices that you can call on.

289
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,780
And these are
definitely one family.

290
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,369
Well, it's obviously symmetric.

291
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:31,040
Shall we check that
it's orthogonal?

292
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,110
So to check that
it's orthogonal,

293
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,540
so I'm going to check that H
transpose H is the identity.

294
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Can I just check that?

295
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,800
Well, H transpose is the same
as H because it was symmetric.

296
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,070
So I'm going to square this guy.

297
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,650
This is really H times H.

298
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm squaring it.

299
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,730
And what do I get if I square--

300
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,830
So I get--

301
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,740
I hope I get the identity,
but let's see it.

302
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,835
What do I get when
I square this?

303
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,020
I get little-- multiply it out.

304
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,170
So I times I is I.

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,590
And then I get some
number of u, u transposes.

306
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,162
How many do I get from that?

307
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:22,400
So I'm squaring this
thing because H transpose

308
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,760
J is the same as H times
H. So I'm squaring it.

309
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,080
So what do I put here?

310
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,740
Four, thanks.

311
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,720
And now I've got this
guy squared with a plus.

312
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,360
So that's four, u, you,
transpose u, u transpose.

313
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,700
Yeah, I'm totally
realizing I've practiced

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,660
for a lifetime doing these
dinky little calculations.

315
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,970
But they are dinky.

316
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,750
And you'll get the
hang of it quickly.

317
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,390
Now what am I hoping
out of that bottom line?

318
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,450
That it is I. We're hoping we're
going to get I. Do we get I?

319
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,770
Yes.

320
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,760
Who sees how to get
I out of that thing?

321
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,190
Yeah, u transpose u
in here is a number.

322
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,730
That was u-- that was column
times row times column times

323
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,570
row.

324
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,750
And I look at in the middle
here is row times column.

325
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,430
And that's the number one
right because it's there.

326
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,240
So that's one and
then I have minus 4

327
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,650
of that plus 4 that that.

328
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,690
They cancel each
other, and I get I.

329
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,260
So those are good matrices.

330
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,920
We'll use them.

331
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,330
We'll use them.

332
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,400
Actually, they're better
than Gram-Schmidt.

333
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,750
So we'll use them in
making things orthogonal.

334
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,750
So what other
orthogonal matrices?

335
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,430
Let's create some.

336
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,410
Creating good
orthogonal matrices is--

337
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,030
you know, it pays off.

338
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,200
Let's think.

339
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:22,790
So there a family named
after this French guy

340
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,900
who lived to 100.

341
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,820
He was a real old timer.

342
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,890
Well, MIT had a faculty
member in math, when I came,

343
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,100
Professor Struik,
who lived to 106.

344
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,420
And I heard him give a lecture
at Brown University at age 100.

345
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,100
And it was perfect.

346
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,020
You could not have
done it better.

347
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,550
So he's my inspiration.

348
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,540
I'm keep going.

349
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,710
I only have I like, n
more years to get there.

350
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,440
And then it's-- well,
it's too many anyway.

351
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,240
So Hadamard, he created--

352
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:06,750
well, that's the
simplest, the smallest.

353
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,410
Now the next guy is
going to be four by four.

354
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm going to put that--

355
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,940
so where I see a
one, I'm going to put

356
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,580
Hadamard one, one, one minus
one, one, one, one minus one.

357
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,610
And then when I say a minus, I'm
going to put an n with a minus.

358
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,300
You saw that picture?

359
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:39,440
It was a picture of H2,
H2, H2, and minus H2.

360
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
That's what I've got there.

361
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,303
And I believe those
columns are orthogonal.

362
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:51,860
Right?

363
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,670
Now what could I do?

364
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,090
Well it's not quite
an orthogonal matrix.

365
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,690
What do I have to do to
make-- this isn't quite

366
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,520
an orthogonal matrix either.

367
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,630
What do I do to make that
an orthogonal matrix?

368
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,000
Divide by square root of two?

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,120
I need unit vectors there.

370
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,190
And here, those links are one
squared, one squared, got four,

371
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,710
square root of four is two.

372
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,720
So I better divide
by the two there.

373
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,190
And now here I'm up to--

374
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,810
yeah.

375
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,080
So that was that one.

376
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,010
Tell me the next one up.

377
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,140
What's that going to be?

378
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,040
Eight by eight?

379
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,640
What's that?

380
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,290
So this is H4 here.

381
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,720
Oops, four.

382
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,330
So tell me, what I should
do for eight by eight.

383
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,240
You know, it's simple.

384
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,560
But that's a good
thing to say about it.

385
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,380
You know, they're
in coding theory,

386
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,040
all sorts of places you want
matrices of ones and minus

387
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,450
ones.

388
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,770
What's H8?

389
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,850
I'm going to build it out of H4.

390
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,810
So what's it going to be?

391
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm going to put an H4 there.

392
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,230
What am I going to put here?

393
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,190
Another H4.

394
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,260
And up here?

395
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,430
Another H4.

396
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,530
And finally, here?

397
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,370
Minus H4.

398
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,190
And I think I've got
orthogonal columns again.

399
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:36,210
Because the columns within these
dot products with themselves

400
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:38,230
give zero and zero.

401
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,030
The dot products from these
columns and these columns

402
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,980
obviously, have the minus.

403
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,120
And the dot products in here
are zero from that and zero

404
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,690
from that.

405
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,010
Yeah, it works.

406
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,770
And we could keep going
to 16 and 32 and 64.

407
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,600
But then up comes a question.

408
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,930
What about H12?

409
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:14,920
Is there ones and minus ones
matrix of size 12, 12 by 12?

410
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,590
It doesn't come directly from
our little pattern, which

411
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,110
is doubling size every time.

412
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,060
But you could still hope.

413
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,890
And it works.

414
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,600
I don't know what
it is, but there's

415
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,000
a there's a matrix of
ones and minus ones 12

416
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,890
orthogonal columns.

417
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,925
So the answer is yes.

418
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,550
So we make an 18.065 conjecture.

419
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:52,090
Every matrix size-- well,
not every matrix size,

420
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,850
because three by three
is not going to work.

421
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,570
One by one is not
going to work either.

422
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,970
But H12 works, H8, H16--

423
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,860
What's our conjecture?

424
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,770
We won't be the first
to conjecture it,

425
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,440
that there is a
ones and minus ones

426
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,290
orthogonal matrix with
orthogonal columns

427
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,570
of every size n.

428
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:25,320
So I'll start the
conjecture, always possible

429
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,470
if n, which is the size
of the matrix, let's say.

430
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,840
What would you guess?

431
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,040
Just take a shot.

432
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,100
You won't be asked for a proof,
because nobody has a proof.

433
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,700
Even?

434
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,310
Well, you could hope for even.

435
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,860
You could look for try six, I
guess, would be the first guy

436
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,360
there.

437
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,700
And I don't think it's possible.

438
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,430
I think six is not possible.

439
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,220
So every even size
is, I think, not

440
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,870
going to work, but a
natural idea to try.

441
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,200
What's the next thought?

442
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,370
Every multiple of four.

443
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,890
If n over a four
is a whole number.

444
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,340
But nobody has a systematic
way to create these things.

445
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,830
So like some of
them, at this point,

446
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,080
we're down to doing
it one at a time.

447
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,430
And we're up to 668.

448
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,680
But we haven't got that one yet.

449
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,520
Isn't that crazy?

450
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
So all this is coming
from Wikipedia.

451
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,450
My source of all that's
good in mathematics

452
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,520
is there on Wikipedia.

453
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,340
Anyway, this is the conjecture.

454
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,800
Conjecture means you
don't have any damn idea

455
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,280
of whether it's true or not.

456
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,710
Is that divisible by four?

457
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,480
Yeah, I guess it would be.

458
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,200
600 certainly is,
and 68 certainly is.

459
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
Yeah, OK.

460
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,570
So I think that's the first one.

461
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,910
If you find one of size
668, just skip the homework

462
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,620
and tell us about that one.

463
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,340
But I don't think
I'll assign that.

464
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,320
Yeah, I must have
searched for it online.

465
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,050
But yeah.

466
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,865
Anyway, so those are
the Hadamard matrices.

467
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,430
Now where else do I remember
orthogonal matrices coming

468
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,930
from?

469
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:44,760
Well, yeah really,
the biggest source.

470
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,400
So when I'm looking for
orthogonal matrices,

471
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,020
I'm looking for a basis
of orthogonal vectors.

472
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,320
And where in math am I
going to find vectors

473
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,700
that come out to be orthogonal?

474
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,340
We haven't seen-- that's the
next section of the notes,

475
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,130
but maybe you are remembering.

476
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,580
Where will we sort of
like, automatically show up

477
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,920
with orthogonal vectors?

478
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,440
They could be the
eye eigenvectors

479
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,830
of symmetric matrix.

480
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,270
And that's where the most
important ones come from.

481
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,970
Oh, I could tell you
about wavelets though.

482
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,910
Wavelets are more
like this picture.

483
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,220
They're ones and minus ones,
or the simplest wavelets

484
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,530
are ones and minus ones.

485
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,540
Before I go on to the
eigenvector business,

486
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,450
can I mention the
wavelets matrices?

487
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,860
Yeah, these are really
important simple and important

488
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,540
constructions.

489
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:55,570
So wavelets- let me
draw a picture of--

490
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,250
I'm going to come up with four--

491
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,440
I'll do the four by four case.

492
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:07,410
And these are the
orthogonal guys.

493
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:14,680
And then the next one
is and down and zero.

494
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:20,980
And the last one is
zero and up and down.

495
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,940
So that's four things.

496
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,850
But let me show you the matrix.

497
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,880
So I'll call it W for wavelets.

498
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,810
So that guy, I'm thinking
of was one, one, one, one.

499
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,320
This guy I'm thinking of as
one, one, minus one, minus one.

500
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,770
It's looking sort
of Hadamard's way.

501
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,870
But there's a difference here.

502
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,770
This guy is one minus
one, zero, zero.

503
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,630
So the wavelengths rescale.

504
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,390
That's the difference between
Hadamard and wavelets.

505
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,880
Wavelets are self-scaling.

506
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,010
And what's the last guy here?

507
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,480
What's the fourth column?

508
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,430
From that fourth wavelet?

509
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:11,460
Zero, zero, one minus one, yeah.

510
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,560
So Haar came up with that.

511
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,610
This is the Haar wavelet, which
was many years before the word

512
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,970
wavelets was invented.

513
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:32,690
He came up with this
construction, the Haar matrix,

514
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,460
the Haar functions.

515
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,840
So they're very simple
functions, but you know,

516
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,680
that makes them usable that the
fact that they're so simple.

517
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,030
Now I don't know if you want
to see the pattern in eight

518
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,600
by eight but let me start
the eight by eight so you'll

519
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,240
know what wavelets are about.

520
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,840
You'll know what these Haar
wavelets are about, anyway.

521
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,540
They're the ones that were
kind of easy to visualize.

522
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,330
So if that's W4, let's
just take a minute.

523
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,680
It won't take long for W8.

524
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,815
So the first column is
going to be eight, one.

525
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,370
And what's the next
column going to be?

526
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,480
Four ones and four
minus ones, like so.

527
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,350
So four ones and
four minus ones.

528
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:46,420
And now the next column, two
ones two minus ones and zeros.

529
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,660
One, one, minus one,
minus one and zero.

530
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:58,310
And the fourth will be zeros
and two ones and two minus ones.

531
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,480
We got half a matrix now.

532
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,290
Now if we just tell me the
fifth, what do you think?

533
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,410
What do I put in the fifth one?

534
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,810
So again, it's going to
squeeze down and rescale.

535
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,740
And what's fifth
column up here that's

536
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,740
going to be ones and
minus ones and zeros now?

537
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,440
So it's not Hadamard, it's Haar.

538
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,430
And what shall I put?

539
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,630
One, one.

540
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,757
Shall I start with one, one?

541
00:32:31,757 --> 00:32:32,590
AUDIENCE: 1 minus 1.

542
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,510
PROFESSOR: Oh!

543
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,330
And then all zeros?

544
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,700
Oh yeah, thanks!

545
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,870
Perfect!

546
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,240
One minus and then all zeros.

547
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,340
And then the next
three columns, we'll

548
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,330
have the one minus one here
and the one minus one here,

549
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,620
and the one minus one here.

550
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,080
And otherwise all zeros.

551
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,930
Yeah.

552
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,130
So you see the pattern.

553
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,200
It's scaling at every step.

554
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,640
So that matrix has
the advantage of being

555
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,670
quite sparse, short of--

556
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,680
This, in my mind is a--

557
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:21,670
or four ones, that get involved
with like, taking the average.

558
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,740
Then this guy is like,
taking the differences

559
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,270
between those and those.

560
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,920
And then this is like taking the
difference at a smaller scale.

561
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,240
And that also at
a smaller scale.

562
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,700
So that's what we keep doing.

563
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,270
Yeah.

564
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:37,600
Yeah.

565
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,380
So that wavelets.

566
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:48,876
It looks so simple
right, but just

567
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:51,030
a one minute
history of wavelets,

568
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,480
so Haar invented
this in like, 1910.

569
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,700
I mean, a long--

570
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,260
forever.

571
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,560
But then you wanted
wavelets said

572
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,110
we're a little
better, and not just

573
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,510
ones and minus ones and zeros.

574
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,670
And that took a lot of thinking.

575
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,690
A lot of people were
searching for it.

576
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,449
And Ingrid Daubechies-- so
I'll just put her name--

577
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,280
became famous for finding them.

578
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:36,560
So in about 1988 she
found a whole lot

579
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,350
of families of wavelets.

580
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,790
And when I say
wavelets, she found

581
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,159
a whole lot of
orthogonal matrices

582
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,630
that had good properties.

583
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,130
Yeah.

584
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,040
So that's the wavelet picture.

585
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,300
OK.

586
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,600
Now to close today
and to connect

587
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,310
with the next lecture on
eigenvalues, eigenvectors,

588
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,520
positive definite matrices--
we're really getting

589
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,520
to the heart of things here.

590
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,220
Let me follow
through on that idea.

591
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:17,950
So the eigenvectors
of a symmetric matrix,

592
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:25,743
but also of an orthogonal
matrix are orthogonal.

593
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,970
And that is really
where, people--

594
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,680
where you can invent--

595
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,570
because you don't
have to work hard.

596
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,210
You just find a
symmetric matrix.

597
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,980
Its eigenvectors are
automatically orthogonal.

598
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,300
That doesn't mean they're
great for use, but some of them

599
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,650
are really important.

600
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,750
And that maybe the
most important of all

601
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,670
is the Fourier.

602
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,630
So you probably have
seen Fourier series sines

603
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,530
and cosines.

604
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,830
Those guys are
orthogonal functions.

605
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,760
But the discrete Fourier series
is what everybody computes.

606
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,500
And those are
orthogonal vectors.

607
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,970
So the are orthogonal
vectors that

608
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,900
go into the discrete
Fourier transform.

609
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,990
And then they're
done at high speed

610
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,360
by the fast Fourier transform.

611
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,520
Those are eigenvectors of Q,
eigenvectors of the right Q.

612
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,390
So let me just tell you
in the right Q that get--

613
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,410
who's eigenvectors--

614
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,110
So here we go.

615
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:50,610
Eigenvectors of
Q-- you will just

616
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,880
be amazed by how
simple this matrix is.

617
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,370
It's just that matrix.

618
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,920
It's called a
permutation matrix.

619
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,782
It just puts the--

620
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:15,840
those are the four, eight,
four Fourier discrete--

621
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,160
let me put that word
discrete up here--

622
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,660
transform.

623
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,260
So I really meant to put
discrete Fourier transform.

624
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,630
Yeah.

625
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,650
The eigenvectors of that
matrix, first of all,

626
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:37,680
they are orthogonal, and then
second, and more important,

627
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,380
they're tremendously useful.

628
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,630
They're the heart of
signal processing.

629
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:50,620
In signal processing, they
just take a discrete Fourier

630
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,270
transform of a vector
before they even look at it.

631
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,910
I mean, like that's
the way to see it,

632
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,990
is split it into
its frequencies.

633
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,930
And that's what the
eigenvectors of this will do.

634
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:07,570
So we're going to see the
discrete Fourier transform.

635
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:15,050
But my point here is to know
that they're orthogonal just

636
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:18,620
comes out of this fact
that the eigenvectors are

637
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,490
orthogonal for any Q.
And that is certainly

638
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,380
a Q. Everybody can see that
those columns are orthogonal.

639
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,840
That's a permutation matrix.

640
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,030
You've taken the columns
of the identity, which

641
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,430
are totally orthogonal,
and you just

642
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,530
put them in a different order.

643
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,230
So a permutation
matrix is a reordering

644
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,910
of the identity matrix.

645
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,740
It's got to be a Q, and
therefore, its eigenvectors

646
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,210
are orthogonal.

647
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,690
And they're just the winners.

648
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,530
I mean, the matrix
of the Fourier matrix

649
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,930
with those four eigenvectors
in it, I'll show you now.

650
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:13,530
We're finishing today by leading
into Wednesday, eigenvectors

651
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,000
and eigenvalues.

652
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And we happen to be doing
eigenvectors and eigenvalues

653
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,600
of a Q, not today, of
an S. Most of the time,

654
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,980
it's a symmetric matrix
whose eigenvectors we take,

655
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,960
but here that happens
to be a Q. Can I

656
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,780
show you the eigenvectors,
the four eigenvectors of that?

657
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,810
Now, oh!

658
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,470
The complex number I
is going to come in.

659
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,510
You have to let it in here.

660
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,270
Yeah, sorry!

661
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,370
If S is a real symmetric matrix,
its eigenvectors are real.

662
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:02,190
But if Q is a orthogonal
matrix, its eigenvectors--

663
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:07,470
even though you couldn't ask for
a more real matrix than that--

664
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:13,450
but its eigenvectors
are at least,

665
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,210
the good way are
complex numbers.

666
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,630
So can I just show you
the eigenvectors of--

667
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,070
So again, overall
the point today

668
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,120
is to see orthogonal matrices.

669
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,870
So I'll just repeat
now while I can--

670
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:54,240
rotations here, reflections,
wavelets, the Householder idea

671
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,350
of reflections of
big, large matrices

672
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,880
that have this form I minus 2
u, u transpose are orthogonal.

673
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,080
And now we're going
to see the big guys,

674
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:12,400
the eigenvectors of Q. Yes?

675
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

676
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,138
PROFESSOR: Ah yeah, we
don't have orthonormal.

677
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:17,680
That's right.

678
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,940
We don't have orthonormal.

679
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,820
I better divide by the
square root of eight.

680
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

681
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,200
PROFESSOR: Oh yes!

682
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,470
Oh, you're right!

683
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:27,970
Sorry.

684
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,390
I just thought I'd get away
with that, but I didn't.

685
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,620
Yeah.

686
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,870
So these guys these
words of eight.

687
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,830
So are these.

688
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,350
But these guys are
square roots of four.

689
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,970
These guys are
square roots of two.

690
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:40,750
Thank you.

691
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,130
Absolutely right.

692
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,270
Absolutely.

693
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,040
Yeah.

694
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,120
OK, so what are the
eigenvectors of a permutation.

695
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,830
This is going to be nice to see.

696
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,010
And I'll use the matrix
F for the eigenvector

697
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:12,280
matrix of that Q up there,
and F is for Fourier.

698
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,840
And it'd be the four
by four Fourier matrix.

699
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,380
OK.

700
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,240
What are the eigenvectors of Q?

701
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,320
OK.

702
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,850
So Q is a permutation.

703
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,450
So like, I'm going to ask
you for one eigenvector

704
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,340
of every permutation matrix.

705
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,170
What vector can you tell me
that actually the eigenvalue

706
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,610
will be one?

707
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,180
What vector can you tell
me where if I permute it,

708
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,670
I don't change it?

709
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,650
One, one, one, one.

710
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,260
Like, it's everywhere
here, one, one, one, one.

711
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,220
So that's the zero
frequency for a vector,

712
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,220
the constant vector, all ones.

713
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,610
Everybody sees if I'm multiply
by Q, it doesn't change.

714
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,110
OK.

715
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,880
Now the next one--

716
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,430
I'll show you the four now.

717
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,720
The next one will be 1
I, I squared and I cubed.

718
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,070
Of course, I squared--

719
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,720
I don't know how many course
6J people are in this audience,

720
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,600
but this is a math building.

721
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,560
We paid for it.

722
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,820
It's 2-190.

723
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,380
And it's I in this room.

724
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,280
Anyway, I is the
first letter in what?

725
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:36,970
Imaginary.

726
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:39,270
Thank you, the first
letter in imaginary.

727
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,080
You can't say jimaginary.

728
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,150
So that's it.

729
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,080
OK.

730
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,510
And then the next one is 1 I
squared, I fourth, I sixth.

731
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,060
And the next one is
1 I cubed, I6 and I9.

732
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,340
Isn't that just beautiful?

733
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,960
And you could show that every
one of those four columns,

734
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:06,970
if you multiply them by Q,
you would get the eigenvalues.

735
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,590
And you would see that
it's an eigenvector.

736
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:17,080
And this is just sort of like a
discrete Fourier stuff, instead

737
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,460
of e to the I, e to the Ix,
e to the 2Ix, e to the 3Ix

738
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:22,960
and so on.

739
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,835
We just have vectors.

740
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,680
So those are the
four eigenvectors

741
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,720
of that permutation.

742
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,960
And those are orthogonal.

743
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,720
Could I just check that?

744
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,050
How do you know that this first
column and the second-- well,

745
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,950
I should really say zeros
column and first column,

746
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,620
if I'm talking frequencies.

747
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,330
Do you see that that's
orthogonal to that?

748
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,480
Well, y is one plus
I plus I squared

749
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,850
plus I cubed equal zero.

750
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:06,360
That's the dot product is this
column one dot column two.

751
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,440
Yeah, you're right.

752
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,420
This happens to come out zero.

753
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,205
Is that right?

754
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:19,130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that
will come out zero.

755
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,540
PROFESSOR: That
will come out zero.

756
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,040
But somebody mentioned
that this isn't right.

757
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,590
It's true that
that came out zero,

758
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:36,550
but when I have imaginary
numbers anywhere around,

759
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,540
this isn't a correct dot
product to test orthogonal.

760
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,680
If I have imaginary--

761
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,160
complex vectors-- if I
have complex numbers,

762
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:52,060
complex vectors, I should test
column one conjugate dotted

763
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,770
with column two--

764
00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:00,730
column I conjugate-- well,
let me take column see,

765
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,230
which ones shall I take?

766
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,660
Maybe that guy and that guy.

767
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,030
Many of them, you luck out here.

768
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:15,000
But really, I should be
taking that conjugate.

769
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,670
So these ones--

770
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,970
But the thing is, the complex
conjugate of one is one.

771
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,700
So that was OK.

772
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,980
But in general, if
I wanted to take

773
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:33,570
column two dotted
with column maybe four

774
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,820
would be a little dodgy--

775
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:36,600
yeah.

776
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,980
Look what happens.

777
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,760
Take that column
and that column.

778
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,450
Take their dot product.

779
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,370
Do it the wrong way.

780
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,500
So what's the wrong way?

781
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,110
Forget about the
complex conjugate

782
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,195
and just do it the usual way.

783
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:55,950
So one times one is one.

784
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,570
I times I cube is?

785
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,430
One.

786
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,110
I squared times I6 is?

787
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:05,610
One.

788
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,380
I'm getting all ones.

789
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,260
I'm not getting
orthogonality there.

790
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,430
And that's because I forgot
that I should take the complex

791
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,010
conjugate-- well, of
these guys-- one--

792
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:21,750
I should take minus I,
minus I, minus I squared--

793
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,500
well, that's real.

794
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,760
So it's OK.

795
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,310
Minus there.

796
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:32,316
So minus I squared
is still minus one.

797
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,250
So now if I do it,
it comes out zero.

798
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,330
So let me repeat again.

799
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,730
Let me just make this statement.

800
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:50,280
If Q transpose Q is
I, and Qx is lambda x,

801
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,230
and Qy is different
eigenvalue y--

802
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,680
so I'm setting up the main fact.

803
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,440
In the last minute, I'm
just going to write down.

804
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,930
So I have an orthogonal matrix.

805
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,990
I have an eigenvector
with eigenvalue lambda.

806
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,740
I have another eigenvector with
a different eigenvalue, mu.

807
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,930
Then the claim is that--

808
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,830
what is the claim
about eigenvectors?

809
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,310
So here, this has an eigenvalue.

810
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,700
This has a different eigenvalue.

811
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,170
I need them to be
different to really know

812
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,520
that the x's and the
y's can't be the same.

813
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,990
So what is it that
I want to show?

814
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

815
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:35,630
PROFESSOR: Yes!

816
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,980
That x-- and I have to
remember to do that.

817
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,640
x transpose y is zero.

818
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,340
That's orthogonality.

819
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,460
That's orthogonality
for a complex vectors.

820
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,440
I have to remember to change
are every I to a minus

821
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,780
I in one of the vectors.

822
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,770
And I can prove that fact
by playing with these.

823
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:07,560
By starting from here,
I can get to that.

824
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,060
OK.

825
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,560
That's it.

826
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,820
We've done a lot
today, a lot of stuff

827
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,340
about orthogonal matrices.

828
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:18,560
Important ones, and those
sources of important ones,

829
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,400
eigenvectors.

830
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,950
And so it will be
eigenvectors on Wednesday.
