8
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:28,470
GILBERT STRANG: OK,
let me make a start.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,390
On the left, you see
the topic for today.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,470
We're doing pretty well.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,200
This completes my review of the
highlights of linear algebra,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,550
so that's five lectures.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,550
I'll follow up on
those five points,

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,510
because the neat part is
it really ties together

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,860
the whole subject.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,485
Eigenvalues, energy, A transpose
A, determinants, pivots--

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,760
they all come together.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,280
Each one gives a test for
positive and definite matrices.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,470
That's where I'm going.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,770
Claire is hoping to come in
for a little bit of the class

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,080
to ask if anybody has
started on the homework.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:31,110
And got Julia rolling, and got
a yes from the auto grader.

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,190
Is anybody like-- no.

24
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,760
You're taking a chance, right?

25
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,110
Julia, in principle, works,
but in practice, it's

26
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,960
always an adventure
the first time.

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,160
So we chose this
lab on convolution,

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,580
because it was the
first lab last year,

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,020
and it doesn't ask
for much math at all.

30
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,300
Really, you're just
creating a matrix

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,770
and getting the auto
grader to say, yes,

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,865
that's the right matrix.

33
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,190
And we'll see that matrix.

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,620
We'll see this
idea of convolution

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,440
at the right time, which
is not that far off.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,170
It's signal processing,
and it's early in part

37
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,100
three of the book.

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,990
If Claire comes in,
she'll answer questions.

39
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,440
Otherwise, I guess it would
be emailing questions to--

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,070
I realize that the deadline
is not on top of you,

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,360
and you've got a whole
weekend to make Julia fly.

42
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll start on the math then.

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,070
We had symmetric-- eigenvalues
of matrices, and especially

44
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,730
symmetric matrices, and
those have real eigenvalues,

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,730
and I'll quickly show why.

46
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,780
And orthogonal eigenvectors,
and I'll quickly show why.

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,850
But I want to move
to the new idea--

48
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,580
positive definite matrices.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,120
These are the best of
the symmetric matrices.

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,320
They are symmetric matrices
that have positive eigenvalues.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,250
That's the easy way to remember
positive definite matrices.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,610
They have positive eigenvalues,
but it's certainly not

53
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,200
the easy way to test.

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,160
If I give you a matrix like
that, that's only two by two.

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,680
We could actually
find the eigenvalues,

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,600
but we would like to have other
tests, easier tests, which

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,420
would be equivalent to
positive eigenvalues.

58
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,830
Every one of those five tests--
any one of those five tests

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,810
is all you need.

60
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,950
Let me start with that
example and ask you to look,

61
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,665
and then I'm going to discuss
those five separate points.

62
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,680
My question is,
is that matrix s?

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,610
It's obviously symmetric.

64
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,690
Is it positive,
definite, or not?

65
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,399
You could compute
its eigenvalues

66
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,779
since it's two by two.

67
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,130
It's energy-- I'll come
back to that, because that's

68
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,529
the most important one.

69
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,320
Number two is
really fundamental.

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,870
Number three would ask
you to factor that.

71
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,020
Well, you don't want
to take time with that.

72
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,610
Well, what do you think?

73
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,410
Is it positive,
definite, or not?

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:39,110
I see an expert in the
front row saying no.

75
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,610
Why is it no?

76
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,690
The answer is no.

77
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,790
That's not a positive
definite matrix.

78
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,170
Where does it let us down?

79
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,170
It's got all positive
numbers, but that's not

80
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,580
what we're asking.

81
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,560
We're asking
positive eigenvalues,

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,670
positive determinants,
positive pivots.

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,270
How does it let us down?

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,510
Which is the easy test
to see that it fails?

85
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,803
AUDIENCE: Maybe determinant?

86
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,970
GILBERT STRANG: Determinant.

87
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,120
The determinant is 15
minus 16, so negative.

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,520
So how is the determinant
connected to the eigenvalues?

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
Everybody?

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,820
Yep.

91
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,700
GILBERT STRANG:
It's the product.

93
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,880
So the two eigenvalues of
s, they're real, of course,

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,600
and they multiply to give the
determinant, which is minus 1.

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,670
So one of them is negative,
and one of them is positive.

96
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,300
This matrix is an
indefinite matrix--

97
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,650
indefinite.

98
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,000
So how could I make
it positive definite?

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
OK.

100
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
We can just play
with an example,

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,840
and then we see these
things happening.

102
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,540
Let's see.

103
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,850
OK, what shall I put in
place of the 5, for example?

104
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,500
I could lower the 4, or I
can up the 5, or up the 3.

105
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,450
I can make the diagonal entries.

106
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,180
If I add stuff to
the main diagonal,

107
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,870
I'm making it more positive.

108
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,230
So that's the
straightforward way.

109
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,420
So what number in
there would be safe?

110
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,130
AUDIENCE: 6.

111
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,400
GILBERT STRANG: 6.

112
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,900
OK.

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,880
6 would be safe.

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,300
If I go up from 5 to
6, I've gotta de--

115
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,540
so when I say here
"leading determinants,"

116
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,240
what does that mean?

117
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,520
That word leading
means something.

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,910
It means that I take
that 1 by 1 determinant--

119
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,920
it would have to pass that.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,360
Just the determinant
itself would not do it.

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
Let me give you an example.

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,470
No for-- let me take
minus 3 and minus 6.

123
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,510
That would have the
same determinant.

124
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,890
The determinant would
still be 18 minus 16--

125
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,730
2.

126
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,550
But it fails the
test on the 1 by 1.

127
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,550
And this passes.

128
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,280
This passes the 1 by 1
test and 2 by 2 tests.

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,890
So that's what this means here.

130
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,480
Leading determinants
are from the upper left.

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,460
You have to check n
things because you've

132
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,260
got n eigenvalues.

133
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,620
And those are the n tests.

134
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,710
And have you noticed the
connection to pivots?

135
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,900
So let's just remember
that small item.

136
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,340
What would be the pivots
because we didn't take

137
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,660
a long time on elimination?

138
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,380
So what would be the pivots
for that matrix, 3-4-4-6?

139
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,870
Well, what's the first pivot?

140
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,250
3, sitting there-- the 1-1
entry would be the first pivot.

141
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:56,520
So the pivots would be 3,
and what's the second pivot?

142
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,070
Well, maybe to
see it clearly you

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,950
want me to take that
elimination step.

144
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,280
Why don't I do it just
so you'll see it here?

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,870
So elimination would subtract
some multiple of row 1

146
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,290
from row 2.

147
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,740
I would leave 1 one alone.

148
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,530
I would subtract some
multiple to get a 0 there.

149
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,270
And what's the multiple?

150
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,550
What's the multiplier?

151
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,570
AUDIENCE: In that much--

152
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,940
GILBERT STRANG: 4/3.

153
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,940
4/3 times row 1, away from
row 2, would produce that 0.

154
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,190
But 4/3 times the 4,
that would be 16/3.

155
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,250
And we're subtracting
it from 18/3.

156
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,990
I think we've got 2/3 left.

157
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,880
So the pivots, which is
this, in elimination,

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,710
are the 3 and the 2/3.

159
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,210
And of course, they're positive.

160
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,300
And actually, you see
the immediate connection.

161
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,750
This pivot is the 2 by 2
determinant divided by the 1

162
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,690
by 1 determinant.

163
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,000
The 2 by 2 determinant,
we figured out--

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,460
18 minus 16 was 2.

165
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,510
The 1 by 1 determinant is 3.

166
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,970
And sure enough, that
second pivot is 2/3.

167
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:32,200
This is not-- so by example,
I'm illustrating what these

168
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,970
different tests--

169
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,030
and again, each test
is all you need.

170
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,790
If it passes one test,
it passes them all.

171
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,370
And we haven't found
the eigenvalues.

172
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,200
Let me do the energy.

173
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,110
Can I do energy here?

174
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,610
OK.

175
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,190
So what's this--

176
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,620
I am saying that this is
really the great test.

177
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,860
That, for me, is the definition
of a positive definite matrix.

178
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,610
And the word "energy"
comes in because it's

179
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,090
quadratic, [INAUDIBLE] kinetic
energy or potential energy.

180
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,060
So that's the energy in the
vector x for this matrix.

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,640
So let me compute
it, x transpose Sx.

182
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,170
So let me put in S
here, the original S.

183
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,580
And let me put in of any
vector x, so, say xy or x1.

184
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,625
Maybe-- do you like x--

185
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,620
xy is easier.

186
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,130
So that's our
vector x transposed.

187
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,500
This is our matrix S.
And here's our vector x.

188
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,100
So it's a function of x and y.

189
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,400
It's a pure quadratic function.

190
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,730
Do you know what I get
when I multiply that out?

191
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,590
I get a very simple,
important type of function.

192
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,880
Shall we multiply it out?

193
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,380
Let's see.

194
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Shall I multiply that by that
first, so I get 3x plus 4y?

195
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:11,890
And 4x plus 6y is what I'm
getting from these two.

196
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,100
And now I'm hitting
that with the xy.

197
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,950
And now I'm going
to see the energy.

198
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,870
And you'll see the pattern.

199
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,670
That's always what
math is about.

200
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,990
What's the pattern?

201
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,920
So I've x times 3x, 3x squared.

202
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,960
And I have y times 6y.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,510
That's 6y squared.

204
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,700
And I have x times 4y.

205
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,860
That's for 4xy.

206
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,690
And I have y times 4x.

207
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,920
That's 4 more xy.

208
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,920
So I've got all those terms.

209
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,720
Every term, every
number in the matrix

210
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,620
gives me a piece of the energy.

211
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,730
And you see that the diagonal
numbers, 3 and 6, those

212
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,830
give me the diagonal pieces,
3x squared and 6y squared.

213
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,760
And then the cross--

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,540
or I maybe call them
the cross terms.

215
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,160
Those give me 4xy and
4xy, so, really, 8xy.

216
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,040
So you could call
this thing 8xy.

217
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,470
So that's my function.

218
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,730
That's my quadratic.

219
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,680
That's my energy.

220
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,120
And I believe that
is greater than 0.

221
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,130
Let me graph the thing.

222
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,510
Let me graph that energy.

223
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,160
OK.

224
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,670
So here's a graph of my
function, f of x and y.

225
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,460
Here is x, and here's y.

226
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,400
And of course, that's
on the graph, 0-0.

227
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,000
At x equals 0, y equals 0,
the function is clearly 0.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,710
Everybody's got his eye-- let
me write that function again

229
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,420
here--

230
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,975
3x squared, 6y squared, 8xy.

231
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,650
Actually, you can see--

232
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,700
this is how I think
about that function.

233
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,020
So 3x squared is obviously
carrying me upwards.

234
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,950
It will never go negative.

235
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,760
6y squared will
never go negative.

236
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,030
8xy can go negative, right?

237
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,930
If x and y have opposite
signs, that'll go negative.

238
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:38,260
But the question is, do
these positive pieces

239
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,065
overwhelm it and make the
graph go up like a bowl?

240
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,610
And the answer is yes, for
a positive definite matrix.

241
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,120
So this is a graph of a
positive definite matrix,

242
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,160
of positive energy, the energy
of a positive definite matrix.

243
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,410
So this is the energy x
transpose Sx that I'm graphing.

244
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,460
And there it is.

245
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,680
This is important.

246
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,590
This is important.

247
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,930
This is the kind of function
we like, x transpose Sx,

248
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:25,960
where S is positive definite, so
the function goes up like that.

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,650
This is what deep
learning is about.

250
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,730
This could be a loss
function that you minimize.

251
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,870
It could depend on
100,000 variables or more.

252
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,890
And it could come from the
error in the difference

253
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:53,070
between training data and
the number you get it.

254
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,080
The loss would be some
expression like that.

255
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,250
Well, I'll make sense of
those words as soon as I can.

256
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:11,500
What I want to say is deep
learning, neural nets, machine

257
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,530
learning, the big computation--

258
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,260
is to minimize an energy--

259
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,850
is to minimize an energy.

260
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,800
Now of course, I
made the minimum

261
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,420
easy to find because
I have pure squares.

262
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,630
Well, that doesn't happen
in practice, of course.

263
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:35,110
In practice, we have linear
terms, x transpose b,

264
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,080
or nonlinear.

265
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,430
Yeah, the loss function doesn't
have to be a [INAUDIBLE] cross

266
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,330
entropy, all kinds of things.

267
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,490
There is a whole dictionary
of possible loss functions.

268
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,710
But but this is the model.

269
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,030
This is the model.

270
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,210
And I'll make it
the perfect model

271
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:01,020
by just focusing on that part.

272
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:09,200
Well, by the way, what would
happen if that was in there?

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,410
I shouldn't have X'd
it out so quickly

274
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,030
since I just put it up there.

275
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,580
Let me put it back up.

276
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,940
I thought better of it.

277
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,260
OK.

278
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:27,350
This is a kind of least squares
problem with some data, b.

279
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,970
Minimize that.

280
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,250
So what would be the
graph of this guy?

281
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,460
Can I just draw the same sort
of picture for that function?

282
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,720
Will it be a bowl?

283
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,820
Yes.

284
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,980
If I have this
term, all that does

285
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,600
is move it off center
here, at x equals 0.

286
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,640
Well, I still get 0.

287
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,140
Sorry.

288
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,520
I still go through that point.

289
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,540
If this is the 0 vector,
I'm still getting 0.

290
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,100
But this, we'll bring it below.

291
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,130
That would produce
a bowl like that.

292
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,460
Actually, it would
just be the same bowl.

293
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,040
The bowl would just be shifted.

294
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,599
I could write that to
show how that happens.

295
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,040
So this is now below 0.

296
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,290
That's the solution
we're after that tells us

297
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,680
the weights in the
neural network.

298
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,380
I'm just using these
words, but we'll soon

299
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,350
have a meaning to them.

300
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,040
I want to find that
minimum, in other words.

301
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,930
And I want to find it for much
more complicated functions

302
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,740
than that.

303
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,410
Of course, if I
minimize the quadratic,

304
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,660
that means setting
derivatives to 0.

305
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,790
I just have linear equations.

306
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:49,160
Probably, I could write
everything down for that thing.

307
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,930
So let's put in some
nonlinear stuff,

308
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:55,790
which way to wiggles the
bowl, makes it not so easy.

309
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,020
Can I look a month ahead?

310
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,190
How do you find--

311
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,890
so this is a big
part of mathematics--

312
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,190
applied math,
optimization, minimization

313
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,470
of a complicated function
of 100,000 variables.

314
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,180
That's the biggest computation.

315
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,180
That's the reason machine
learning on big problems

316
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,980
takes a week on a
GPU or multiple GPUs,

317
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,340
because you have
so many unknowns.

318
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,240
More than 100,000
would be quite normal.

319
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,960
In general, let's just have
the pleasure of looking ahead

320
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,130
for one minute, and then
I'll come back to real life

321
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,560
here, linear algebra.

322
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:51,050
I can't resist thinking aloud,
how do you find the minimum?

323
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:58,110
By the way, these functions,
both of them, are convex.

324
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,100
So that is convex.

325
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,290
So I want to connect
convex functions, f--

326
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,350
and what does convex mean?

327
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,460
It means, well, that
the graph is like that.

328
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,660
[LAUGHTER]

329
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Not perfect, it could--

330
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,280
but if it's a
quadratic, then convex

331
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,410
means positive
definite, or maybe

332
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,810
in the extreme,
positive semidefinite.

333
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,070
I'll have to mention that.

334
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,250
But convex means it goes up.

335
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,630
But it could have wiggles.

336
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,020
It doesn't have to be
just perfect squares

337
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,720
in linear terms,
but general things.

338
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,060
And for deep learning,
it will include non--

339
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,750
it will go far
beyond quadratics.

340
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,580
Well, it may not be convex.

341
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,530
I guess that's also true.

342
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,120
Yeah.

343
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,230
So deep learning has
got serious problems

344
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,570
because those
functions, they may

345
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:16,150
look like this but then over
here they could go nonxconvex.

346
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,520
They could dip
down a little more.

347
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,580
And you're looking for this
point or for this point.

348
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,520
Still, I'm determined to tell
you how to find it or a start

349
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,780
on how you find it.

350
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,980
So you're at some point.

351
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,810
Start there, somewhere
on the surface.

352
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,900
Some x, some vector
x is your start, x0--

353
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,030
starting point.

354
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:58,020
And we're going to just take a
step, hopefully down the bowl.

355
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,900
Well of course, it would
be fantastic to get there

356
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,950
in one step, but that's
not going to happen.

357
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,570
That would be solving a big
linear system, very expensive,

358
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,190
and a big nonlinear system.

359
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,320
So really, that's what
we're trying to solve--

360
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,300
a big nonlinear system.

361
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,050
And I should be on this
picture because here we

362
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,790
can see where the minimum is.

363
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,980
But they just shift.

364
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,420
So what would you do if
you had a starting point

365
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,240
and you wanted to go
look for the minimum?

366
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,730
What's the natural idea?

367
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,010
Compute derivatives.

368
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,810
You've got calculus
on your side.

369
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,300
Compute the first derivatives.

370
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,550
So the first derivatives
with respect to x--

371
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,210
so I would compute the
derivative with respect

372
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,990
to x, and the derivative
of f with respect to y,

373
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,990
and 100,000 more.

374
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,750
And that takes a little while.

375
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,760
And now I've got
the derivatives.

376
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,955
What do I do?

377
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:03,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

378
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,600
GILBERT STRANG: I
go-- that tells me

379
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,170
the steepest direction.

380
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,500
That tells me, at
that point, which

381
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,930
way is the fastest way down.

382
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,090
So I would follow--

383
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,890
I would do a gradient descent.

384
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,720
I would follow that gradient.

385
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,920
This is called the gradient,
all the first derivatives.

386
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,528
It's called the gradient of f--

387
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:25,070
the gradient.

388
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,030
Gradient vector-- it's
a vector, of course,

389
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,440
because f is a function
of lots of variables.

390
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,970
I would start down
in that direction.

391
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,230
And how far to go, that's
the million dollar question

392
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,480
in deep learning.

393
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,210
Is it going to hit 0?

394
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:52,870
Nope.

395
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,400
It's not.

396
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,120
It's not.

397
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,040
So basically, you
go down until it--

398
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,430
so you're traveling here in
the x, along the gradient.

399
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,330
And you're not going to hit 0.

400
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,200
You're all going here
in some direction.

401
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,940
So you keep going down
this thing until it--

402
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,290
oh, I'm not Rembrandt here.

403
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,830
Your path down-- think of
yourself on a mountain.

404
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,460
You're trying to go down hill.

405
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,960
So you take-- as
fast as you can.

406
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,190
So you take the steepest
route down until--

407
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,830
but you have blinkers.

408
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,330
Once you decide on a direction,
you go in that direction.

409
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,900
Of course-- so what will happen?

410
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,610
You'll go down for
a while and then

411
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,980
it will turn up again when
you get to, maybe, close

412
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,940
to the bottom or maybe not.

413
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,270
You're not going to hit here.

414
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,760
And it's going to
miss that and come up.

415
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,250
Maybe I should draw it
over here, whatever.

416
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:16,540
So it's called a line search,
to decide how far to go there.

417
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,655
And then say, OK stop.

418
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,190
And you can invest a lot
of time or a little time

419
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,880
to decide on that
first stopping point.

420
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,220
And now just tell me,
what do you do next?

421
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,070
So now you're here.

422
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,580
What now?

423
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,520
Recalculate the gradient.

424
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,840
Find the steepest way
down from that point,

425
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,830
follow it until it turns
up or approximately,

426
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,160
then you're at a new point.

427
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,330
So this is gradient descent.

428
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:54,550
That's gradient descent,
the big algorithm

429
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:00,110
of deep learning of neural
nets, of machine learning--

430
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,440
of optimization, you could say.

431
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,150
Notice that we didn't
compute second derivatives.

432
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,680
If we computed
second derivatives,

433
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,640
we could have a fancier
formula that could

434
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,410
account for the curve here.

435
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,390
But to compute
second derivatives

436
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,380
when you've got hundreds
and thousands of variables

437
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,620
is not a lot of fun.

438
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:30,010
So most effectively,
machine learning

439
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,910
is limited to first
derivatives, the gradient.

440
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,940
OK.

441
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,580
So that's the general idea.

442
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:48,850
But there are lots and
lots of decisions and--

443
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,930
why doesn't that-- how
well does that work,

444
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,200
maybe, is a good
question to ask.

445
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:04,860
Does this work pretty well or
do we have to add more ideas?

446
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,020
Well, it doesn't
always work well.

447
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,370
Let me tell you
what the trouble is.

448
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:20,380
I'm way off-- this is
March or something.

449
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,840
But anyway, I'll
finish this sentence.

450
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:30,590
So what's the problem with
this gradient descent idea?

451
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,680
It turns out, if you're
going down a narrow valley--

452
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,400
I don't know, if you can sort
of imagine a narrow valley

453
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,900
toward the bottom.

454
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,980
So here's the bottom.

455
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,880
Here's your starting point.

456
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,510
And this is-- you have to
have think of this as a bowl.

457
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,050
So the bowl is--

458
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,540
or the two eigenvalues,
you could say--

459
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,700
are 1 and a very small number.

460
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,610
The bowl is long and thin.

461
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,750
Are you with me?

462
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,240
Imagine a long, thin bowl.

463
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,230
Then what happens for that case?

464
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,120
You take the steepest descent.

465
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,210
But you cross the valley,
and very soon, you're

466
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,800
climbing again.

467
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,890
So you take very,
very small steps,

468
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:24,200
just staggering back
and forth across this

469
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,920
and getting slowly, but too
slowly, toward the bottom.

470
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,740
So that's why things
have got to be improved.

471
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:41,320
If you have a very small
eigenvalue and a very large

472
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,160
eigenvalue, those tell you the
shape of the bowl, of course.

473
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,440
And many cases will
be like that-- have

474
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,510
a small and a large eigenvalue.

475
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,640
And then you're
spending all your time.

476
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,870
You're quickly going up the
other side, down, up, down, up,

477
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,590
down.

478
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:06,450
And you need a new idea.

479
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,420
OK, so that's really--

480
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,520
so this is one major reason
why positive definite

481
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,460
is so important because
positive definite gives

482
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,600
pictures like that.

483
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,690
But then, we have
this question of,

484
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,630
are the eigenvalues
sort of the same size?

485
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,790
Of course, if the
eigenvalues are all equal,

486
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,040
what's my bowl like?

487
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,170
Suppose I have the identity.

488
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:36,210
So then x squared plus y
squared is my function.

489
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,930
Then it's a perfectly
circular bowl.

490
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,160
What will happen?

491
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,320
Can you imagine a
perfectly circular--

492
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,710
like any bowl in the kitchen is
probably, most likely circular.

493
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,590
And suppose I do
gradient descent there.

494
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,600
I start at some point on
this perfectly circular bowl.

495
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,980
I start down.

496
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,690
And where do I
stop in that case?

497
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,630
Do I hit bottom?

498
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,205
I do, by symmetry.

499
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,900
So if I take x squared plus
y squared as my function

500
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,250
and I start somewhere, I
figure out the gradient.

501
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,970
Yeah.

502
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,460
The answer is I'll go
right through the center.

503
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:32,960
So really positive eigenvalues,
positive definite matrices

504
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,370
give us a bowl.

505
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:39,470
But if the eigenvalues
are far apart,

506
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,050
that's when we have problems.

507
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,810
OK.

508
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm going back to my
job, which is this--

509
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,730
because this is so nice.

510
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:57,540
Right.

511
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,970
Could you-- well,
the homework that's

512
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:09,350
maybe going out this minute
for middle of next week

513
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,540
gives you some
exercises with this.

514
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:20,730
Let me do a couple of things,
a couple of exercises here.

515
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,890
For example, suppose I have a
positive definite matrix, S,

516
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:31,650
and a positive definite matrix,
T. If I add those matrices,

517
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,600
is the result positive definite?

518
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,140
So there is a perfect
math question,

519
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,208
and we hope to answer it.

520
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,660
So S and T--

521
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,470
positive definite.

522
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,180
What about S plus T?

523
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,470
Is that matrix
positive definite?

524
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,130
OK.

525
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,320
How do I answer such a question?

526
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,920
I look at my five tests
and I think, can I use it?

527
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,210
Which one will be good?

528
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,150
And one that won't tell
me much is the eigenvalues

529
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,960
because the
eigenvalues of S plus T

530
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,970
are not immediately clear from
the eigenvalues of S and T

531
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,260
separately.

532
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,120
I don't want to use that test.

533
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,540
This is my favorite test,
so I'm going to use that.

534
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,790
What about the energy in--

535
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,140
so look at the energy.

536
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:39,860
So I look at x
transpose, S plus T x.

537
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,200
And what's my question
in my mind here?

538
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,300
Is that a positive number
or not, for every x?

539
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,340
And how am I going to
answer that question?

540
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,320
Just separate those
into two pieces, right?

541
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,270
It's there in front of me.

542
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,880
It's this one plus this one.

543
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,380
And both of those are positive,
so the answer is yes, it

544
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,530
is positive definite.

545
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,030
Yes.

546
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,870
You see how the
energy was right.

547
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,530
I don't want to compute the
pivots or any determinants.

548
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,180
That would be a nightmare trying
to find the determinants for S

549
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,690
plus T. But this one
just does it immediately.

550
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,380
What else would be a good
example to start with?

551
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,240
What about S inverse?

552
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,260
Is that positive definite?

553
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,660
So let me ask S
positive definite,

554
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,310
and I want to ask
about its inverse.

555
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,175
So its inverse is
a symmetric matrix.

556
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,990
And is it positive definite?

557
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,170
And the answer-- yes.

558
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,790
Yes.

559
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,630
I've got five tests, 20% chance
at picking the right one.

560
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,220
Determinants is not good.

561
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,520
The first one is great.

562
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,970
The first one is the good
one for this question

563
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,650
because the eigenvalues.

564
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,200
So the answer is yes.

565
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,890
Yes, this has-- eigenvalues.

566
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,520
So what are the
eigenvalues of S inverse?

567
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,810
1 over lambda?

568
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,946
So-- yes, positive
definite, positive definite.

569
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,680
Yep.

570
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,070
What about-- let me
ask you just one more

571
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,000
question of the same sort.

572
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,250
Suppose I have a matrix, S,
and suppose I multiply it

573
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:03,440
by another matrix.

574
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,940
Oh, well.

575
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,510
OK.

576
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:12,860
Suppose-- do I want
to ask you this?

577
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,060
Suppose I asked you about
S times another matrix,

578
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:29,010
M. Would that be
positive definite or not?

579
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,980
Now I'm going to
tell you the answer

580
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,880
is that the question wasn't
any good because that matrix is

581
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,000
probably not symmetric,
and I'm only dealing

582
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,860
with symmetric matrices.

583
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,090
Matrices have to be
symmetric before I

584
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,400
know they have real eigenvalues
and I can ask these questions.

585
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,050
So that's not good.

586
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,664
But I could-- oh, let's see.

587
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,010
Let me put it in
an orthogonal guy.

588
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,810
Well, still that's
not symmetric.

589
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,470
But if I put the--

590
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,950
it's transpose over there.

591
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,530
Then I made it symmetric.

592
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,370
Oh, dear, I may be getting
myself in trouble here.

593
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,490
So I'm starting with
a positive definite S.

594
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,620
I'm hitting it with
an orthogonal matrix

595
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,120
and its transpose.

596
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,080
And my instinct carried
me here because I know

597
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,560
that that's still symmetric.

598
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,060
Right?

599
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,470
Everybody sees that?

600
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,430
If I transpose this, Q
transpose will come here,

601
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,300
S, Q will go there.

602
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,390
It'll be symmetric.

603
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,880
Now is that positive definite?

604
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,960
Ah, yes.

605
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,335
We can answer that.

606
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:47,920
Can we?

607
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,760
Is that positive definite?

608
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,430
So remember that this
is an orthogonal matrix,

609
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,930
so also, if you wanted me to
write it that way, I could.

610
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,060
And what about
positive-definiteness

611
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,970
of that thing?

612
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,100
Answer, I think, is yes.

613
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,090
Do you agree?

614
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,070
It is positive definite?

615
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,050
Give me a reason, though.

616
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,530
Why is this positive definite?

617
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:27,710
So that word similar, this
is a similar matrix to S?

618
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,700
Do you remember what similar
means from last time?

619
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,250
It means that sum
M and its inverse

620
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,860
are here, which they are.

621
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,080
And so what's the
consequence of being similar?

622
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,470
What do I know about a
matrix that's similar to S?

623
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:44,977
It has--

624
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:46,060
AUDIENCE: Same [INAUDIBLE]

625
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,435
GILBERT STRANG:
Same eigenvalues.

626
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:49,990
And therefore, we're good.

627
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,800
Right?

628
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,580
Or I could go this way.

629
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,400
I like energy, so
let me try that one.

630
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,060
x transpose, Q transpose, SQx--

631
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,310
that would be the energy.

632
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,020
And what am I trying to show?

633
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,270
I'm trying to show
it's positive.

634
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:16,180
So, of course, as
soon as I see that,

635
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,500
it's just waiting for me to--

636
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,760
let Qx be something
called y, maybe.

637
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,092
And then what will this be?

638
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:27,050
AUDIENCE: y [INAUDIBLE]

639
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,800
GILBERT STRANG: y transpose.

640
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,850
So this energy would be the
same as y transpose, Sy.

641
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,400
And what do I know about that?

642
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,530
It's positive because
that's an energy in the y,

643
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,390
for the y vector.

644
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,740
So one way or another,
we get the answer yes

645
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,774
to that question.

646
00:37:51,774 --> 00:37:53,659
OK.

647
00:37:53,659 --> 00:37:54,159
OK.

648
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:06,350
Let me introduce the
idea of semidefinite.

649
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,450
Semidefinite is the borderline.

650
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,820
So what did we have?

651
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,400
We had 3, 4, 4.

652
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,120
And then when it was 5,
you told me indefinite,

653
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,960
a negative eigenvalue.

654
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,460
When it was 6, you told me
2 positive eigenvalues--

655
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,510
definite.

656
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,510
What's the borderline?

657
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,880
What's the borderline there?

658
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,440
It's not going to be an integer.

659
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,410
What do I mean?

660
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,222
What am I looking
for, the borderline?

661
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,220
So tell me again?

662
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,120
AUDIENCE: 16 over--

663
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,960
GILBERT STRANG: 16/3,
that sounds right.

664
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,760
Why is that the borderline?

665
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

666
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,540
GILBERT STRANG: Because
now the determinant is--

667
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,280
AUDIENCE: 0.

668
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,030
GILBERT STRANG: 0.

669
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:56,760
It's singular.

670
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,550
It has a 0 eigenvalue.

671
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,870
There's a 0 eigenvalue.

672
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,270
So that's what
semidefinite means.

673
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,730
Lambdas are equal to 0.

674
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,780
Wait a minute.

675
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,620
That has a 0 eigenvalue
because it's determinant is 0.

676
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,120
How do I know that the other
eigenvalue is positive?

677
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,730
Could it be that the
other ei-- so this

678
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,380
is the semidefinite
case we hope.

679
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,710
But we'd better
finish that reasoning.

680
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,040
How do I know that the other
eigenvalue is positive?

681
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,340
AUDIENCE: Trace.

682
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,330
GILBERT STRANG: The
trace, because adding

683
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,900
3 plus 16/3, whatever
the heck that might give,

684
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,480
it certainly gives
a positive number.

685
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,650
And that will be
lambda 1 plus lambda 2.

686
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,980
That's the trace.

687
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,200
But lambda 2 is 0.

688
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,210
We know from this it's singular.

689
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,830
So we know lambda 2 is 0.

690
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,870
So lambda 1 must be 3 plus 5--

691
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,910
5 and 1/3.

692
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:06,070
The lambdas must be 8 and
1/3, 3 plus 5 and 1/3, and 0.

693
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,350
So that's a positive
semidefinite.

694
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,050
If you think of the
positive definite matrices

695
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:20,710
as some clump in matrix space,
then the positive semidefinite

696
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,320
definite ones are sort of
the edge of that clump.

697
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,390
There the boundary of
the clump, the ones

698
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:31,210
that are not quite inside
but not outside either.

699
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:37,600
They're lying right on the edge
of positive definite matrices.

700
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,800
Let me just take a--

701
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:45,510
so what about a
matrix of all 1s?

702
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,060
What's the story on that
one-- positive definite, all

703
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,470
the numbers are positive,
or positive semidefinite,

704
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,840
or indefinite?

705
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,070
What do you think here?

706
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,270
1-1, all 1.

707
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,150
AUDIENCE: Semi--

708
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,790
GILBERT STRANG: Semidefinite
sounds like a good guess.

709
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,620
Do you know what the eigenvalues
of this matrix would be?

710
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,110
AUDIENCE: 0 [INAUDIBLE]

711
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:20,280
GILBERT STRANG: 3, 0, and
0-- why did you say that?

712
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,110
AUDIENCE: Because 2 [INAUDIBLE]

713
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,360
GILBERT STRANG: Because we
only have-- the rank is?

714
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,867
AUDIENCE: 1.

715
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,700
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah,
we introduced that key

716
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,190
where the rank is 1.

717
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,750
So there's only one
nonzero eigenvalue.

718
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:37,320
And then the trace tells
me that number is 3.

719
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,700
So this is a positive
semidefinite matrix.

720
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:51,650
So all these tests change
a little for semidefinite.

721
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,310
The eigenvalue is
greater or equal to 0.

722
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,520
The energy is greater
or equal to 0.

723
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,320
The A transpose A-- but
now I don't require--

724
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,710
oh, I didn't discuss this.

725
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,010
But semidefinite would
allow dependent columns.

726
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,430
By the way, you've
got to do this for me.

727
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:14,000
Write that matrix as A
transpose times A just

728
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,275
to see that it's
semidefinite because--

729
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,090
so write that as A
transpose A. Yeah.

730
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,840
If it's a rank 1 matrix, you
know what it must look like.

731
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,460
A transpose A, how many terms
am I going to have in this?

732
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,590
And now I'm thinking back to the
very beginning of this course

733
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:49,350
if I pulled off the pieces.

734
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:55,740
In general, this is lambda 1
times the first eigenvector,

735
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,140
times the first
eigenvector transposed.

736
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,690
AUDIENCE: Would it just
be a vector of three 1s?

737
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,350
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah, it would
just be a vector of three 1s.

738
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:03,850
Yeah.

739
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:10,380
So this would be
the usual picture.

740
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,810
This is the same as the
Q lambda, Q transpose.

741
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:20,220
This is the big fact for
any symmetric matrix.

742
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:27,390
And this is symmetric,
but its rank is only 1,

743
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:33,570
so that lambda 2 is
0 for that matrix.

744
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,820
Lambda 3 is 0 for that matrix.

745
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,200
And the one eigenvector
is the vector 1-1-1.

746
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,090
And the eigen-- so this
would be 3 times 1-1-1.

747
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,250
Oh, I have to do--

748
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,270
yeah.

749
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,130
So I was going to do 3
times 1-1-1, times 1-1-1.

750
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,950
But that gives me 3-3-3.

751
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,405
That's not right.

752
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:03,850
AUDIENCE: Normalize them.

753
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,558
GILBERT STRANG: I have
to normalize them.

754
00:44:05,558 --> 00:44:06,210
That's right.

755
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:06,710
Yeah.

756
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,510
So that's a vector whose
length is the square root of 3.

757
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,800
So I have to divide by
that, and divide by it.

758
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,500
And then the 3 cancels
the square root of 3s,

759
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,110
and I'm just left
with 1-1-1, 1-1-1.

760
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:20,610
Yeah.

761
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

762
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,810
GILBERT STRANG: So
there is a matrix--

763
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:29,260
one of our building-block
type matrices because it only

764
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,910
has one nonzero eigenvalue.

765
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,780
Its rank is 1, so it could
not be positive definite.

766
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,310
It's singular.

767
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,110
But it is positive semidefinite
because that eigenvalue

768
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,380
is positive.

769
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,360
OK.

770
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,090
So you've got the idea of
positive definite matrices.

771
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,780
Again, any one of
those five tests

772
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,260
is enough to show that
it's positive definite.

773
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,580
And so what's my goal next week?

774
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,970
It's the singular value
decomposition and all

775
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,520
that that leads us to.

776
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,880
We're there now,
ready for the SVD.

777
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,480
OK.

778
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,700
Have a good weekend,
and see you--

779
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,680
oh, I see you on
Tuesday, I guess.

780
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,440
Right-- not Monday
but Tuesday next week.
