00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,450
GILBERT STRANG: OK,
let me start again.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,430
Thanks for helping
with Professor Rao

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,470
and working on the labs
the last two times.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,420
I was saying the
labs were really

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,000
for his class,
which is 90 minutes,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,930
so that we were kind of running
out of time just answering

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,660
those questions, getting the
system to say, OK, keep going.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,700
Anyway, he's going
to develop those.

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,740
And I think they'll
be a good thing.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:04,140
So actually, the second
lab, as I was watching it,

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,000
I was thinking of
a math question.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,940
And may I report to you
on that math question?

20
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,810
So you remember the lab
was completing a matrix.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,710
You got some entries.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,860
And you can put in any other
entries in the other positions.

23
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,775
And the question was can you
complete it to a rank 1 matrix?

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,110
Here's my question.

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,380
What positions are OK?

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,870
And what positions
could you maybe not

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,160
be able to complete
to a rank 1 matrix?

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,310
Examples are the best.

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,370
So I'm looking at
this question here.

30
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:58,890
OK, I'm looking for a rank 1
matrix of the form x column y

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,530
transpose, or uv
transpose, I guess.

32
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,039
Those are the letters where
you used to, uv transpose.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,955
And that means of course
that aij is ui times vj.

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,140
So we're able to choose--

35
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,915
we have m u's.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,680
Let me ask a question.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,330
Could I complete-- so let
me take m equal n equal 3.

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,740
So a 3 by 3 matrix.

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,810
I'm going to give you m
plus n minus 1, which is 3

40
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,931
plus 3 minus 1, five positions.

41
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:10,600
And suppose I give non-zeros
in which five positions?

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,230
So where is that number m
plus n minus 1 coming from?

43
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,260
Well, because I have
m u's and I have

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,490
n v's for a rank 1 matrix--

45
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,990
i goes from 1 to m,
j goes from 1 to n.

46
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,940
So I have m plus n.

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:38,210
But obviously I could require
the first u to be a 1.

48
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,300
In other words, when
I'm multiplying those,

49
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,700
there is one degree of freedom
that is sort of repeated here,

50
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,530
because if I'm just given--

51
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,710
anyway, you see it,
that I can rescale the u

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,470
so that the first u is a 1.

53
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,580
And that leave me
m plus n minus 1.

54
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,700
So could I give you
these five numbers

55
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,490
and could you complete
that to a rank 1 matrix?

56
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,899
So those are non-zeros.

57
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,300
Why do I say non-zeros?

58
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,690
Because if that number
happened to be a zero,

59
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,370
I'd have bad news there.

60
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,510
If I prescribed that one and
I prescribed it to be zero,

61
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,640
then if every column has to
be a multiple of that column,

62
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,710
these would all have to be 0.

63
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,970
So I don't want that.

64
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,790
I want to be able to
prescribe five numbers.

65
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:53,970
And therefore, they
better not be zero.

66
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,850
Could you complete the
job with that choice

67
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,980
of a five positions?

68
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,270
I think you could.

69
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,800
Because how would you
decide on that number?

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,540
Well, I mean at
least one way to look

71
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,630
at it is, what would
that number be there?

72
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,740
That number would be chosen.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,860
There would be one and only
one choice for that that

74
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,360
would give rank 1.

75
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,730
In fact, that little 2 by 2
determinant would have to be?

76
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,710
0, right?

77
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,690
All the columns are supposed
to be multiples of one column.

78
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,360
All the rows are supposed
to be multiples of one row.

79
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,830
All the 2 by 2s are rank 1.

80
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,210
And rank 1 for a 2 by
2 means determinant 0.

81
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,910
So I would know what
that one had to be.

82
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,320
That number would have to be
a 1 2 times a 2 1 over a 1 1.

83
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,090
Every 2 by determinant
has to be 0 here.

84
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,940
If I want rank 1,
I can't stand any 2

85
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,230
by 2s that are
invertible matrices.

86
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,250
So all the determinants
have to be zero.

87
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,160
And, of course, then
these three numbers

88
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,560
would allow me to fill in there.

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,160
Those three numbers would
allow me to fill that.

90
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,580
Those three numbers will
allow me to fill that.

91
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,770
It would be easy, easy.

92
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,290
So that I can see that those
are five positions that work.

93
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,500
Now, give me five
positions that won't work.

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
So this is good.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,410
This is check.

96
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,370
Now, I want one where
I can't make it work.

97
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,315
So let me give that
number, that number.

98
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,240
So I'm looking for
something that fails,

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,010
a set of positions that fails.

100
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,090
And then I want to be able to
test, does the set of positions

101
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,210
work for any non-zeros
or does it not work?

102
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,360
What am I looking for here?

103
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,970
A different one that works?

104
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,320
OK, so what else would
work, apart from that?

105
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,870
Let's see, I suppose
I take that one.

106
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,290
Now, what about
that position there?

107
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,600
I must not choose
that one, right?

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,260
I must not choose that one,
because that would complete a 2

109
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,940
by 2.

110
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,460
And if I gave the wrong
numbers, the determinant

111
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,330
wouldn't be zero.

112
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,740
And I would be failed.

113
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,330
So I must not give
that position.

114
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,370
Maybe I could give
that position.

115
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,550
Maybe I could give this one.

116
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,930
How's that?

117
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,470
If I had those five, would
I be able to complete?

118
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,160
It looks good anyway.

119
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,250
It looks good.

120
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,770
Let's see, how would I
go about completing that?

121
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,530
Let's see, I would
know what that number

122
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,380
had to be from this 2 by 2.

123
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,280
From this 2 by 2, I
would know that number.

124
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,980
From this-- where now?

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,900
This and this and this,
no, that's not any good.

126
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,840
What do I do now?

127
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,420
How would I get this number?

128
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,760
Oh, OK, I guess I have to use--

129
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,010
this would complete that.

130
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, this 2 by 2, oh,
yeah, OK, no problem.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,950
That would complete
that one, right?

132
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,710
But this one, I don't think
I can get immediately.

133
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,000
But I can get it.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,170
Once I know these, then
obviously I can get that,

135
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,950
right?

136
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,840
So it's sort of nice
combinatorial problem.

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,300
Which five positions will work?

138
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,980
Which five will not work?

139
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,710
How do I tell?

140
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,210
Of course, that's for a 3 by 3.

141
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,530
Yeah, so let me--

142
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,580
I had like a bigger example.

143
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,390
Let me move up to 4 by 4.

144
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:24,190
So here comes the idea
that I learned last night

145
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,360
from a math professor
who does combinatorics.

146
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,350
So these people who
do combinatorics,

147
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,570
they know stuff that
the rest of us don't.

148
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:45,850
So his view is these would
be rows, one, two, three.

149
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,070
I may add another row.

150
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,860
Let me do a 4 by 4.

151
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,440
And these would be columns,
one, two, three, four.

152
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,810
Now, I'm looking for seven--

153
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:04,330
so if I prescribe an entry, I'll
put in an edge between them.

154
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,630
So let me let me hype
this one up to 4 by 4.

155
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,360
Here, a good one.

156
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,980
Actually, I'll just
draw this picture.

157
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,100
So suppose I prescribe
the 1, 1-- oh, yeah,

158
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,530
and over here I'll show
you what I've done.

159
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,160
So that I'm putting
in the 1, 1 position.

160
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,620
I'm looking for 7, right?

161
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,860
4 plus 4 minus 1, seven numbers.

162
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,670
OK.

163
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,320
Then, I'll put in,
this is row 2 column 1.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,110
Row 2 column 1,
that would be there.

165
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,930
Then I'll put in a 2 to 4.

166
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,140
So that would be
row 2, column 4.

167
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,530
Then I'll put in a 3 to 4.

168
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,920
So that would be
row 3, column 4.

169
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,700
And finally, I'll put in--

170
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,100
let's see, so how
many have I done?

171
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,280
One, two, three, four,
and I've got to get up

172
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,970
to seven, prescribed seven.

173
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,060
Well, I'll put more in.

174
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,140
So on row 4, I gave 2, 3, and 4.

175
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,080
And did I put in this one?

176
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,940
Yes, I did.

177
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,090
So I've now prescribed
seven numbers.

178
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,230
Could I complete the
matrix to a rank 1 matrix?

179
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,340
You see the math question.

180
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,850
If I'm given seven
positions there--

181
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,850
this is another way to
look at the same picture.

182
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,810
This is I put in an
edge for every x.

183
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,070
So if I have seven x's,
I've got seven edges.

184
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,060
And this is called
a bipartite graph.

185
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,050
So it's a graph.

186
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,680
I've got four nodes
here, four nodes here.

187
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,960
So I have eight nodes.

188
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,800
It's a bipartite
graph because I have

189
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,370
one part of nodes over there,
one part of nodes here.

190
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,980
Bipartite means two parts.

191
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,460
So the rows give me
one part of the edges.

192
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,550
The columns give me the
other part of the edges.

193
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,500
And all the connections
go between the parts.

194
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,420
I don't have any lines
from a row to a row,

195
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:49,100
because the whole code is that
this tells me where those seven

196
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,930
positions are.

197
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,360
Now, I'm just going ask you,
can I complete the graph?

198
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,340
Can I complete the matrix?

199
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,460
Can I complete rank
1 matrix there?

200
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,060
What do you think?

201
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,380
And the real question
is, what's the rule?

202
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,520
How can I see when I
can't complete the matrix,

203
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,290
something gets in the way?

204
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,490
Here, what got in the
way was this 2 by 2.

205
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,830
And actually, I asked
the question on email,

206
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,620
can I always complete it--
yeah, so that would be

207
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,390
the question I could ask you.

208
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,420
Can I always
complete the graph--

209
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:43,430
complete the matrix to have rank
1 when I don't run into this?

210
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,050
Is that all I have
to avoid, a 2 by 2,

211
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,430
where I'm given all
four entries-- oh, yeah,

212
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,600
this I was able to complete.

213
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Sorry to-- let's do one.

214
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:08,720
If I'm given those entries
and maybe some others,

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,180
I guess seven altogether,
that's a failure.

216
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,440
I can't prescribe any non-zeros
in those seven positions,

217
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,380
because if I prescribe
any non-zeros,

218
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,790
I probably won't have a
zero determinant here.

219
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,260
I won't have rank 1.

220
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,030
That column will not be a
multiple of that column.

221
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,390
Whatever I do here,
I've screwed up already.

222
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,500
So that's a fail.

223
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,530
Let me take that picture and
turn it into this picture, so

224
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,570
rows, columns.

225
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,040
So if I take these
seven, that's a row 1--

226
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,050
row 1, 2, 3, 4, so
row 1 goes to 1 and 2.

227
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,470
Row 2 goes to 1 and 2.

228
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,530
Row 3 goes to 4.

229
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,520
And row 4 goes to 3 and 4.

230
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,360
That's a failure.

231
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,040
And how do I know
it's a failure?

232
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,190
I want to now come
up with the answer.

233
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,180
So if I give any seven
positions or any m plus n

234
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,270
minus 1 positions like that, I
can create a graph like that,

235
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,730
just following the
rule that you saw.

236
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,270
Those seven positions gave
me seven edges in my graph.

237
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,980
And it's a bipartite
graph because every edge

238
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,230
goes from this part
over to this park.

239
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,000
And that's a failure.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,790
And the reason it's a failure
is that I have here a cycle.

241
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,390
If I go across,
down, across, down, I

242
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,560
come back where I started.

243
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,740
That would be a
cycle equals failure.

244
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,480
Everybody see I can't give
these four numbers generally.

245
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Once I've given you three,
I don't have any freedom

246
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,170
left with that fourth one.

247
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,220
And the way to see
that in this picture

248
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,700
is that there's a cycle.

249
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,890
So here is the
combinatorics thing

250
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:42,340
that Professor Postnikov
told me about last night.

251
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,630
You can complete to a
rank 1 matrix if and only

252
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,750
if no cycles.

253
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:59,710
So that just answered
my question perfectly.

254
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,030
This one is one where I can't
complete, and it's got a cycle.

255
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,660
A cycle meaning you come
back to where you started.

256
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,560
So my question to him was,
can you always complete it

257
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
if there are no 2
by 2s in the way?

258
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,760
And his answers told me that
maybe the 2 by 2s could be OK,

259
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
but there could be a
bigger cycle, a longer

260
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
cycle that would screw you up.

261
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,590
So let me close with an
example of that sort.

262
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:46,230
So this is going
to be fail again.

263
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,470
But no 2 by 2 is responsible.

264
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,950
In other words,
it's going to fail.

265
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,680
I won't be able to
complete this matrix,

266
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,810
even though there aren't
any completed 2 by 2s.

267
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,440
The 2 by 2, I knew
immediately was failure.

268
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
So let me see if I can do that.

269
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,880
So here's a failure.

270
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,440
This is rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

271
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
And this is columns 1, 2, 3, 4.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,790
And I think I'm going
to have 1 given there.

273
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:29,550
And I sort of
started this before.

274
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:34,290
And 2 goes to 1 and 4.

275
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,605
And 3 goes to 4.

276
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,760
And 4 goes to--

277
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,300
let's see.

278
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,150
OK, now, I've only
put it in 2, 4, 5.

279
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,680
And I'm allowed seven.

280
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,760
But I think I'm already
in trouble here.

281
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,570
So let me draw this
picture for that.

282
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,020
So this is rows 1, 2, 3, 4.

283
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,330
And this is column 1, 2, 3, 4.

284
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,300
And now, I've
prescribed that one.

285
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,300
Oh, no, that goes from--

286
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,000
oh, I've forgotten the
right way to do the picture.

287
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,740
My bipartite graph wasn't
what it should have been.

288
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,660
So the 1, 2, 3, 4.

289
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,820
OK, now I'm going to do the
bipartite graph picture that

290
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,170
goes with this picture.

291
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,870
So 1 to 1.

292
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,545
2 to 1.

293
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,190
2 to 4.

294
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,500
But what I'm going to do--

295
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,660
let me just say what
I'm going to do.

296
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,370
I'm going to create a cycle
over here of length 6.

297
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,340
A cycle of length 4 is
what I got from a 2 by 2.

298
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,860
From my 2 by 2, that
took me one way, back

299
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,560
another, back
another, back another.

300
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,920
I completed a cycle.

301
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,390
I came back to where I
started with just four edges.

302
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,740
Now, I want to complete
a cycle with six edges.

303
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,000
So let me draw it
in the picture here.

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,410
Now, I'm going to put an
edge from 4 back to 1.

305
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:44,550
So 1 to 1, 1 to
4, 2 to 1, 2 to 4.

306
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,930
Have I got any--

307
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,060
I think 1, 2, ah, damn.

308
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,280
I didn't want a short cycle.

309
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,740
I want a bigger, longer cycle.

310
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,690
Let me get the darn thing here.

311
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,140
So 2 to 4 is not what I want.

312
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,630
So I start a cycle.

313
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,500
OK, go somewhere.

314
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,460
Go back.

315
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,270
Go somewhere.

316
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,380
Go back.

317
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,610
Go somewhere.

318
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,300
Go back.

319
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,970
Now, there I got it.

320
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,340
Length six.

321
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,030
Length six.

322
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,180
So let me put the x's
in where they belong.

323
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,240
So 1 is connected to 1 and 4.

324
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
That's right.

325
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,255
2 is connected to 2 and 4.

326
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,920
3 is not connected to anybody.

327
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,690
Let's put that one in.

328
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,910
And 4 is connected to 1 and 2.

329
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,090
4 is connected to 1 and 2.

330
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:45,280
OK, I believe that picture
goes with that picture.

331
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,780
Now, my claim is
that there are no

332
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:57,260
there is no 2 by 2 in here that
shows me immediately failure.

333
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,360
But I will fail--

334
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,420
I can't live with those--

335
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,520
that looks like eight.

336
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,195
Sorry, I only want seven.

337
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,990
So shall I just take--

338
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,264
sorry?

339
00:22:14,264 --> 00:22:18,120
AUDIENCE: You've got
3, 4 in the wrong spot.

340
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
GILBERT STRANG: 3, 4, and
it shouldn't be there.

341
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,130
All right, OK, thanks.

342
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,270
Right.

343
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,400
You see I'm not a
combinatorics person.

344
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,450
But it's so beautiful
to have the inspiration

345
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,930
to convert that
picture to this picture

346
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,410
and then realize that a
problem in this picture

347
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,650
is a cycle in this picture.

348
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,360
That's the whole message.

349
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,230
That's the whole message,
that when I'm looking here

350
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:52,320
a cycle means that I've
built in a requirement, which

351
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,780
random non-zeros won't satisfy.

352
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,130
So you see that anyway.

353
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:05,580
You see the cycle, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, yeah.

354
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,710
So there's a cycle there.

355
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,320
So somehow those six
x's, whichever they are--

356
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,140
I guess all but the 3 by 3.

357
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,030
So I could take away
this part of the graph

358
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:26,820
and just have 3 and 3, and there
would be 6 numbers in there

359
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,540
and that's too many.

360
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,573
OK, I'm going to stop
there exactly half way

361
00:23:33,573 --> 00:23:34,365
through that class.

362
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,780
Well, I'm going to stop
there with a question, which

363
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,100
I don't know if I dare send
another question to Professor

364
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,830
Postnikov, who answered
this one perfectly.

365
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,950
But my question would
be, when could you

366
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,920
complete a rank 2 matrix?

367
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,920
What positions could you fill
in and be able to reach rank 2?

368
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,860
That would be trouble, right?

369
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,850
I don't know where we
would go with that.

370
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,670
But for us, for 18.065,
that's the natural question.

371
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,460
Rank 1 is super special for us.

372
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:21,330
And rank 2 or rank R
would be the general case.

373
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,510
So they're good math questions.

374
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:29,250
Now, topic 2, convolution.

375
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,450
So the first lab
in the course just

376
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,410
happened to have a convolution
and used that word and so on.

377
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,030
But we didn't connect
that with the lectures.

378
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,150
So now, I'd like to
talk about convolutions,

379
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,360
which are extremely important.

380
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,040
And they are
important in machine

381
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:12,470
learning because they give you
a set of weights connecting--

382
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,800
they're an efficient way to--

383
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,760
let me show you.

384
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
Let me show you.

385
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,495
So a convolution matrix--

386
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,760
and this will be a cyclic
convolution matrix.

387
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:44,030
And the shorthand for
cyclic convolution matrix

388
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,822
is circulant.

389
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:46,280
So what does a
circulant look like?

390
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,990
I'll call it C.

391
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:54,140
A circulant has
constant diagonals.

392
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,080
That's what convolution
means matrix wise.

393
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,925
Convolution means constant
down each diagonal.

394
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,640
And cyclic means complete,
circle around again.

395
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:27,560
The diagonals circle around.

396
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,300
So I'll just show
you what I mean.

397
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,500
So 4 by 4, let's say.

398
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,480
So it has some entry to--

399
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,010
there's one diagonal.

400
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,140
Here is another diagonal.

401
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,130
So now I have
constant diagonals.

402
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,440
But if it's going to
be a circulant matrix--

403
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,810
and this is the best family
of matrices in the world.

404
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,500
The algebra is just
terrific for these matrices.

405
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,130
And that's why they're the
heart of signal processing.

406
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,820
So this is a constant
diagonal matrix.

407
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,980
But it's not yet a circulant.

408
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:15,040
That diagonal circles
around to be completed.

409
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,050
Every diagonal has
four entries here.

410
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,840
So let me take
another one, say 1, 1.

411
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,660
Then that would
circle around to 1, 1.

412
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,300
And this guy could be 0.

413
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,420
There's a circulant matrix.

414
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,760
Do you understand
then what the entry--

415
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,350
you only need four numbers,
say the first column.

416
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,190
If you prescribe the first
column of a circulant matrix,

417
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:52,420
then you've told Matlab, for
example, all it needs to know.

418
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,050
If you tell it one column, it
can get all the other columns

419
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,320
just by cyclic shift.

420
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,720
There's the first
column, 2, 0, 1, 5.

421
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,880
The second column is 2, 0,
1, 5 shifted down by one.

422
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,590
The next column is again
shifted down by one, 2, 0, 1, 5.

423
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,680
And the last column
is 2, 0, 1, 5.

424
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,790
So they're all the same
columns after a cyclic shift.

425
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:27,610
So the key matrix in this is
really a cyclic shift matrix.

426
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:37,540
Say 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0-- so it
just has one non-zero diagonal.

427
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,340
And then it's cyclic.

428
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,050
Do you see that in
fact this matrix C,

429
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:54,380
I can produce this matrix
C from P and P squared?

430
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,070
What would P squared be?

431
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:05,030
And I'll write it here without
while keeping our eye on P.

432
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:10,160
So if I square that matrix,
what matrix would I get?

433
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,820
So this is a shift by one.

434
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,540
If I shift by one again, that's
multiplying it again by P.

435
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,790
So that would give me P squared.

436
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,410
What what's in the--

437
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,540
OK, so what happens now?

438
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,390
It's a shift by two I guess.

439
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,744
So this will be 0, 0, 1, 0.

440
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:40,740
This will be 0, 0, 0, 1.

441
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,090
Then it's cyclic still.

442
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,870
So I'll put in the 1s there
and then just fill in the 0s.

443
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,700
So P squared, shift by two.

444
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,400
You start out with this one.

445
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,000
Is that right?

446
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,780
Yes.

447
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,290
Yes.

448
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,280
OK.

449
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,850
OK.

450
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,690
Yeah, let's just make
it multiply a vector,

451
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,760
x0, x1, x2, x3.

452
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,815
What it does is it puts--

453
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,160
well, I've started the
numbering with 2 here.

454
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,860
x2, x3, x0, and x1.

455
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,710
So it's shifted it by
two and cyclically.

456
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,040
So the x2, x3 that got
shifted off the bottom

457
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,100
come back to the top.

458
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,690
So the first property
is, of circulants--

459
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,837
so I suppose I have
matrices C and D circulants.

460
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:07,158
So fact 1, C times D
is also a circulant.

461
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,360
So if I multiply
circulant matrices,

462
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,630
I get more circulant matrices.

463
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:21,230
And the identity is
a circulant matrix.

464
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,300
I have a little group of
matrices, the best little group

465
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,910
of matrices there is.

466
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,420
I can multiply two
guys in the group,

467
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,470
and I get another
one in the group.

468
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,960
Why is CD also a circulant?

469
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,690
Let's see, can we see
why that fact is true?

470
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,560
I guess here here's
my way to look at it.

471
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,040
A circulant matrix--
let me put it here--

472
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:59,230
a circulant matrix, every
circulant matrix is C0 times

473
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:05,860
the identity circulant plus
C1 times the single shift

474
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:12,580
plus C2 times the double shift
plus C3 times the triple shift.

475
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,500
That's what it takes
to put C0, C1, C2,

476
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,980
and C3 on those diagonals.

477
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,590
C0I is obviously on
the main diagonal.

478
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,100
C1P-- remember what P is--

479
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,470
that puts C1 on
the next diagonal.

480
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,580
Then C2P squared, when I square
this, I've shifted by one more.

481
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,100
So it will put C2
on that diagonal.

482
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,410
And finally, C3 would
go in those positions.

483
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:55,920
So every circulant matrix
is a polynomial in P,

484
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,840
in a single shift.

485
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,290
This is any
combination of shifts.

486
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,160
This is a single shift.

487
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,270
That's a double shift.

488
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,410
That's a triple shift.

489
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,140
That's a zero shift.

490
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:14,870
And if I take combinations
I get a circulant matrix.

491
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,720
So now, I can see why
CD is also a circulant,

492
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,710
because this is a
polynomial in P.

493
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:31,350
And this is a polynomial
in P. And when

494
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:37,170
I multiply those together,
I get a polynomial in P.

495
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:44,340
But usually, if I multiply
a third degree polynomial

496
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,380
by another third
degree polynomial--

497
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,660
so say I'm looking at 4
by 4 circulant matrices--

498
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,000
so this would be a polynomial
of P in P third degree 3.

499
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,760
And this would be a
polynomial of degree 3.

500
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,440
So that would give me a
polynomial of degree 6.

501
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,745
But I don't want that.

502
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:14,370
That somehow I have to
define multiplication

503
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,230
so that I want
this to be degree--

504
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:25,010
these are all supposed
to be 4 by 4 matrices,

505
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,420
just like that one.

506
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,159
That's twice the identity
plus five P plus 1P squared

507
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,020
plus 0P cubed.

508
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,300
And suppose I square that.

509
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,810
Then, again, I'm going to
get up a circulant matrix.

510
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,920
And I don't want it
to go up to degree 7.

511
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,540
I just want four terms
in my polynomial.

512
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,949
I just want the main diagonal
and the next three diagonals

513
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:56,000
and then cycling around
completes the matrix.

514
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,020
So how to get degrees 3?

515
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,280
That's the question then.

516
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,130
Can you just tell me the answer?

517
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,260
So I'm multiplying-- yeah,
let's just do an example.

518
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:35,100
So I've C0, C1P, C2P squared,
C3P cubed times D0 plus D1P

519
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,730
plus D2P squared and D3P cubed.

520
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:45,885
So P is 4 by 4 circular shift.

521
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,380
And I'm writing the 4
by 4 matrix that way.

522
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,020
This should be the
identity, of course.

523
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,450
You knew that.

524
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,550
OK, so when I
multiply those guys,

525
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,650
why do I not get degree six?

526
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,990
Why is that product--

527
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:16,475
like P cubed times P
cubed C3P cubed times

528
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:21,810
DP3 cubed, that gives me
C3D3 P to the sixth power.

529
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,478
So what's up?

530
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:24,020
What do I do?

531
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,680
Yeah.

532
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,820
AUDIENCE: Does P to the
4 equal to identity?

533
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,790
GILBERT STRANG:
Yes, that's the key.

534
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,670
That's the periodic part.

535
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,900
P to the 4 equal the identity.

536
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,350
Thank you.

537
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,480
Yeah.

538
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,740
So the P to the sixth term
is really a P squared term.

539
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,440
The P to the fifth term
is really a P term.

540
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,800
P the fourth term is really
a P to the zero term.

541
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,570
So I'm just doing cyclic
convolution actually.

542
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,870
Let me just say when
I'm multiplying--

543
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:04,450
yeah, so now, I'm
telling you what--

544
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,100
I can first tell you
what convolution is

545
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,170
and then what cyclic
convolution is.

546
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:15,200
And listen up to this, because
it's a good thing to know.

547
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,340
So, first of all, convolution.

548
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,480
So suppose I want to take
the convolution of 3, 1, 2--

549
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,620
that's often the symbol for
a convolution-- with 4, 6, 1.

550
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,870
So what does that mean?

551
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,400
I've got a vector.

552
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,020
So for me, what's hiding
there is polynomial 3

553
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:53,380
plus x plus 2x squared times
4 plus 6x plus 1x squared.

554
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,340
And I just multiply them out.

555
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,235
And I get 5--

556
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,830
so I get 3 times
4 gives me a 12.

557
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,650
3 times 6x is 18x.

558
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,060
But I've also got 4x from here.

559
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,780
So I've got 22x.

560
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,150
So I just do that multiplication
as of polynomials.

561
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,410
And what I'm doing is
convolution with the vectors.

562
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:30,400
And here's the way you
wrote it in first grade.

563
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,070
So here's first grade.

564
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:36,700
2, 12, 8.

565
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,160
You haven't learned
to carry yet.

566
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,950
So 12 goes in there as 12.

567
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,070
Then 1 is 4, 6, 1.

568
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,900
And 3 is 12, 18, 3.

569
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,490
And then you add up.

570
00:38:51,490 --> 00:39:01,090
So you have 2, 13,
17, 22, and 12.

571
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,160
So that's the answer there.

572
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,690
That's the convolution--

573
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,990
I guess I have to take it from--

574
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,130
yeah-- 12.

575
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,080
3 times four gave 12.

576
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,100
Now, 3 times 6 plus 1
times 4 that's the 22.

577
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,140
Oh, yeah, we already
started here.

578
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,510
But now, what's after that 17?

579
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:23,432
Why did I say 17?

580
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:25,692
AUDIENCE: 8 plus 6 plus 3.

581
00:39:25,692 --> 00:39:27,390
GILBERT STRANG: Oh,
8 plus 6 plus 3.

582
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,210
Thanks.

583
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,560
17.

584
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,900
And then 12 plus 1, 13.

585
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,020
And then 2.

586
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,070
That's non-cyclic.

587
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,010
So that's convolution.

588
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,730
Oh, if I want it
to be non-cyclic,

589
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,990
I don't put a circle in.

590
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,740
So that's a symbol for
ordinary convolution.

591
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,600
If you do the Matlab command
conv for convolution,

592
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,390
if you gave it those
vectors, it would give you

593
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,200
a vector with five
components as a result.

594
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,920
But now, let me make it cyclic.

595
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,360
So what's going to happen
now when I make it cyclic?

596
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:20,540
So this represents 12, 22P,
17P squared, 13P cubed.

597
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:25,370
And what's 13P cubed?

598
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,450
If n is 3 and I'm
doing 3 by 3 matrices,

599
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:33,940
then 13P cubed is the same as?

600
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,860
13, right?

601
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,360
P cube is I.

602
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,090
So the 13 will go back there.

603
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,670
And the 2 will be P fourth.

604
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:49,540
And it will go back as P.
So now with convolution,

605
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:59,080
cyclic convolution gives 12
and 13, 25, 22 and 2, 24,

606
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,855
and the 17.

607
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:09,010
So I'm getting back a vector of
length 3 just as I wanted to.

608
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:15,430
If I have a 3 by 3 matrix,
convolution cyclic circulant

609
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,730
matrix, with those three
diagonals and these three

610
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,980
diagonals, then I want
the answer to be a 3

611
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,220
by 3 matrix with
these diagonals.

612
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,830
So again, matrix multiplication
of circulant matrices

613
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,750
corresponds exactly to
multiplying polynomials

614
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,610
cyclically.

615
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,420
And that's cyclic convolution.

616
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,520
And then there's
just one little trick

617
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,340
to see if you've
got the numbers.

618
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:52,790
I believe that it should be true
that if 3 plus 1 plus 2 is 6,

619
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,720
4 plus 6 plus 1 is
11, and I believe

620
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,950
that those should add to what?

621
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,026
What do I hope that they add to?

622
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:04,526
66.

623
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,920
I'm a little nervous about
doing it, but I think we can.

624
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,430
Yeah, so 49, 59, 66, check.

625
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:24,760
Yeah, so the digits, the sum
of the digits of one factor

626
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,280
multiplies the sum of the
digits of the other factor

627
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,390
to give the sum of the
digits in the convolution.

628
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,890
And that would be
true whether we're

629
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:39,230
doing cyclic, which is bringing
the 13 and the 2 back in or not

630
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,975
cyclic, where we have 5 numbers.

631
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,680
That's actually a check that
I don't know if you ever

632
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,980
thought about that
in second grade,

633
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,730
multiplying these
numbers, multiplying

634
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,360
that number by that
number and getting

635
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,960
some answer, which probably half
the class did not get right.

636
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,370
Then fifth grade, they're
kind of getting it.

637
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,450
But if they knew a check, so
they could have just added

638
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,390
these numbers to get
11, added these numbers

639
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,630
to get 6, multiplied
those to get 66,

640
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,180
and check that
those added to 66.

641
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,780
That never occurred to me I
admit in second grade either.

642
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,450
But now you know.

643
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,830
Now you can pass second grade.

644
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:46,200
So this is the picture
for cyclic convolution.

645
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,850
And I just have a
few minutes left

646
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:51,510
to tell you about the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

647
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,700
of these matrices.

648
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,350
So what can you tell me
about the eigenvalues--

649
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,450
or say, the eigenvectors?

650
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:06,150
I have a matrix P. It happens
to be a permutation matrix.

651
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,310
But it's a matrix.

652
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:13,650
Then I take this
polynomial in the matrix.

653
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:20,290
What can you tell me about
eigenvectors of this matrix C?

654
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:25,120
So my C looks like that.

655
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,240
And I'm asking you for
the eigenvectors of that.

656
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:37,730
And I'm saying that that is a
polynomial, sum of powers of P,

657
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,570
like so.

658
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,460
In fact, the numbers here
just come off the diagonals.

659
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,610
So what about the eigenvectors?

660
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:50,000
AUDIENCE: All 1s.

661
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,070
GILBERT STRANG: Well,
that is an eigenvector.

662
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:52,700
That's true.

663
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,000
The vector of all 1s
will be an eigenvector.

664
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,560
With what eigenvalue actually?

665
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,320
AUDIENCE: C2 plus C1.

666
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,760
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.

667
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,420
So what I want you to see
is the eigenvectors of C

668
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,300
are the same as the
eigenvectors of P.

669
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,370
If I have an
eigenvector of P, that's

670
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:18,050
also an eigenvector of P squared
and P cubed in a combination.

671
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:32,270
So eigenvectors of P
are eigenvectors of C.

672
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,260
So then the question is, what
are the eigenvectors of P?

673
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,710
You see what I mean?

674
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,280
It didn't really matter if
I'm looking for eigenvectors

675
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,670
what those numbers were.

676
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:50,620
The point is that those numbers
were constant on diagonals

677
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,830
and that therefore it's built
out of 1 matrix P, built out

678
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:02,840
of 1 matrix P. So all I have to
know is the eigenvectors of P.

679
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,390
So that's the final step here.

680
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,810
What are the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of P?

681
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:27,660
So eigenvectors, eigenvalues
for P equal 1, 1, 1, and 1, say.

682
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,980
And otherwise zeros.

683
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:40,170
So somebody mentioned that
the vector of 1, 1, 1, 1, that

684
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,340
is an eigenvector, because
if I do that multiplication,

685
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,380
it shifts this vector down
and cyclically around.

686
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,400
But that just brings
back the same vector.

687
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,750
So lambda is 1.

688
00:46:53,750 --> 00:47:03,560
And that's an eigenvector
with eigenvalue 1.

689
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,930
But this is a 4 by 4 matrix.

690
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,280
AUDIENCE: 1 minus 1, 1 minus 1.

691
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,320
GILBERT STRANG: Ah, now you're
guessing 1 minus 1, 1 minus 1.

692
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,220
Interesting.

693
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,800
Well, tell me an
eigenvector for minus 1.

694
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:27,780
Do you want to just
alternate signs there?

695
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,970
So let me let me do that
multiplication times 1 minus 1,

696
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:36,860
1 minus 1.

697
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,350
Of course, I don't have
to do that multiplication.

698
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:41,540
I'm just going to shift this.

699
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,060
So I'm going to shift
that down, 1 minus 1

700
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,180
and cyclically around.

701
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,150
And now, what's the eigenvalue?

702
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,540
It is an eigenvector.

703
00:47:53,540 --> 00:48:00,770
And what multiple of that
vector gives that vector?

704
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,860
AUDIENCE: Minus 1.

705
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,860
GILBERT STRANG: Minus 1.

706
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,980
So that was a good idea.

707
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,520
But the rest of what
you said was a bad idea,

708
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:24,500
because the next eigenvectors
got to be somewhere else.

709
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,200
We've just got one eigenvalue
there and one there.

710
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,850
And we haven't
got the other two.

711
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,450
So what are the
other two eigenvalues

712
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,230
of this permutation matrix?

713
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,580
AUDIENCE: 1.

714
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,140
GILBERT STRANG: 1, that's right.

715
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,750
We're in a circulant world.

716
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,490
Draw a circle.

717
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:49,530
So the eigenvectors are
the four roots of 1.

718
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,660
Complex.

719
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,280
So 1 and minus 1 you've got.

720
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,230
These are the lambdas.

721
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,970
But the other ones are
I and minus I. Yeah.

722
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,050
Yeah.

723
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,890
Why don't I, since
time's up, let me

724
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,250
leave until Friday
the eigenvalues

725
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:16,710
and eigenvectors for in
general, for arbitrary size.

726
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,380
But that's a picture
of the eigen--

727
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,690
we're close to the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of every--

728
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:29,070
all circulants have
the same eigenvectors.

729
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,900
All circulants have that
eigenvector, 4 by 4.

730
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,900
All circulants have
that eigenvector 4 by 4.

731
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,610
And we'll find the other two.

732
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:44,400
OK, so I'll see you Friday
for those and the convolution

733
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,810
rule, which is the most
important rule in signal

734
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:49,610
processing.

735
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:50,110
OK.

736
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,660
Thanks.
